18771349,"Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is a transcriptional repressor and tumor suppressor inhibiting melanoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo in animal models. In this study, we analyzed the impact of in vivo primary tumor gene expression of PLZF on the long-term survival of malignant melanoma patients. PLZF expression was assessed by using DNA microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of 41 primary malignant melanomas from patients with a defined histology and a close to 20-year clinical follow-up, of 29 melanoma metastases, and of 6 different melanoma cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, log-rank statistics and Cox regression analysis were employed to identify the impact of PLZF expression on long-term survival. We detected PLZF expression in 92% of primary melanoma tumors in vivo but not in melanoma cell lines in vitro. By univariate analysis, we identified: (1) PLZF mRNA expression < or = 10,000 mRNA copies/mug total tumor RNA, (2) Breslow tumor thickness >4 mm, and (3) American Joint Committee on Cancer stages IIC, IIIB, IIIC, and IV as statistically significant pretreatment risk factors. We defined a continuous prognostic index (i.e., risk score) for primary melanoma patients based on the regression coefficient of PLZF mRNA expression. Applying a cutpoint to the prognostic index at - 1.65, patients were assigned to one of two risk groups: low-risk patients (n = 28) with a median overall survival of 79 months (5-year survival of 61%) and high-risk patients (n = 13) with a median overall survival of 32 months (5-year survival of 23%) (p < 0.05). This is the first time that PLZF mRNA expression has been linked to a prognostic model for primary malignant melanoma patients to derive prognostic groups for clinical purposes (e.g., improved melanoma immunotherapies)."
11774264,"Suppression subtractive hybridization, comparing mRNA expression profiles of common nevocellular nevi and melanoma metastases, was used to identify potential markers of melanoma progression. From the metastases we isolated XAGE-1b, a 470 bp transcript of the XAGE-1 gene. In general, expression of XAGE-1b was much more prominent than expression of the longer XAGE-1 transcript, isolated from Ewing's sarcoma. The XAGE-1b open-reading frame codes for a putative protein of 81 amino acids, harboring a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal and a C-terminal acidic transcription-activation-like domain. On the nucleotide level, XAGE-1b has a 50% homology with members of the GAGE family. However, homology between the corresponding proteins is weak. Expression of XAGE-1b in normal tissues was mainly restricted to testis, while placenta and brain were sporadically positive. In human tumor cell lines as well as in human tumor lesions, expression was most frequently found in melanocytic tumors and Ewing's sarcoma. In the different stages of melanocytic tumor progression, expression was exclusively seen in melanoma metastases (38%; n = 61), while all tested common and atypical nevi (n = 10) as well as primary melanomas (n = 8) were negative. Upregulation of expression after treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was detected in 1 of 4 human melanoma cell lines tested. The XAGE-1 gene consists of 4 exons and is located on chromosome Xp11.21-Xp11.22. After transfection into COS cells, the corresponding protein can direct the coupled fluorescent protein to the nucleus, showing a distinct speckled staining aspect. Our data imply the nuclear cancer/testis-associated XAGE-1b to be a marker for late melanocytic tumor progression."
18312439,"One major risk factor for cutaneous melanoma is chronic sun-exposure and oxidative stress. Among various oxidative DNA damages, 8-oxoquanine is the most abundant and is potentially mutagenic if not sufficiently repaired. The human 8-oxoquanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) gene specifically repairs 8-oxoguanine, and this gene shows frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human tumors. In this study, we investigate whether hOGG1 LOH occurs in melanoma in situ (MIS) and adjacent atypical melanocytic hyperplasia (AMH)."
24595385,"Uveal melanoma (UM) tumors require large doses of radiation therapy (RT) to achieve tumor ablation, which frequently results in damage to adjacent normal tissues, leading to vision-threatening complications. Approximately 50% of UM patients present with activating somatic mutations in the gene encoding for G protein αq-subunit (GNAQ), which lead to constitutive activation of downstream pathways, including protein kinase C (PKC). In this study, we investigated the impact of small-molecule PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) and sotrastaurin (AEB071), combined with ionizing radiation (IR), on survival in melanoma cell lines."
24840574,"Malignant melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, with a high propensity to metastasize to the brain. More than 60% of melanomas have the BRAFV600E mutation, which activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [1]. In addition, increased PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway activity has been demonstrated, through the loss of activity of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN [2]. Here, we treated two melanoma brain metastasis cell lines, H1_DL2, harboring a BRAFV600E mutation and PTEN loss, and H3, harboring WT (wild-type) BRAF and PTEN loss, with the MAPK (BRAF) inhibitor vemurafenib and the PI3K pathway associated mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. Combined use of the drugs inhibited tumor cell growth and proliferation in vitro in H1_DL2 cells, compared to single drug treatment. Treatment was less effective in the H3 cells. Furthermore, a strong inhibitory effect on the viability of H1_DL2 cells, when grown as 3D multicellular spheroids, was seen. The treatment inhibited the expression of pERK1/2 and reduced the expression of pAKT and p-mTOR in H1_DL2 cells, confirming that the MAPK and PI3K pathways were inhibited after drug treatment. Microarray experiments followed by principal component analysis (PCA) mapping showed distinct gene clustering after treatment, and cell cycle checkpoint regulators were affected. Global gene analysis indicated that functions related to cell survival and invasion were influenced by combined treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that combined therapy with vemurafenib and temsirolimus is effective on melanoma brain metastasis cells in vitro. The presented results highlight the potential of combined treatment to overcome treatment resistance that may develop after vemurafenib treatment of melanomas."
25687217,"To evaluate the prevalence of BAP1 germline mutations in a series of young patients with uveal melanoma (UM), diagnosed before age 30."
25113440,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) tightly regulate tyrosine phosphorylation essential for cell growth, adhesion, migration, and survival. We performed a mutational analysis of the PTP gene family in cutaneous metastatic melanoma and identified 23 phosphatase genes harboring somatic mutations. Among these, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase delta (PTPRD) was one of the most highly mutated genes, harboring 17 somatic mutations in 79 samples, a prevalence of 21.5%. Functional evaluation of six PTPRD mutations revealed enhanced anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, melanoma cells expressing mutant PTPRD were significantly more migratory than cells expressing wild-type PTPRD or vector alone, indicating a novel gain-of-function associated with mutant PTPRD. To understand the molecular mechanisms of PTPRD mutations, we searched for its binding partners by converting the active PTPRD enzyme into a ""substrate trap"" form. Using mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation, we report desmoplakin, a desmosomal protein that is implicated in cell-cell adhesion, as a novel PTPRD substrate. Further analysis showed reduced phosphatase activity of mutant PTPRD against desmoplakin. Our findings identify an essential signaling cascade that is disrupted in melanoma. Moreover, because PTPRD is also mutated in glioblastomas and adenocarcinoma of the colon and lung, our data might be applicable to a large number of human cancers."
22815634,"Uveal melanoma (UM) has been the subject of intense interest due to its distinctive metastatic pattern, which involves hematogenous dissemination of cancerous cells toward the liver in 50% of patients. To search for new UM prognostic markers, the Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) technique was used to isolate genes that are differentially expressed between UM primary tumors and normal uveal melanocytes (UVM)."
26769193,"Like uveal melanomas, primary leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms (LMNs) frequently carry GNAQ and GNA11 mutations. However, it is currently unknown whether these LMNs harbor mutations in BAP1, SF3B1 and/or EIF1AX like uveal melanomas as well. In this study, we used Sanger sequencing for the detection of mutations in SF3B1 (hotspots in exon 14 and 15) and EIF1AX (exon 1 and 2 and flanking intronic regions) in a series of 24 primary LMNs. Additionally, BAP1 immunohistochemistry was used as a surrogate marker for the detection of inactivating mutations in the BAP1 gene."
19521982,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a member of the caveolin family, regulates caveolae-associated signaling proteins, which are involved in many biological processes, including cancer development. Cav-1 was found to exert a complex and ambiguous role as oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the cellular microenvironment. Here we investigated Cav-1 expression and function in a panel of melanomas, finding its expression in all the cell lines. The exception was the primary vertical melanoma cell line, WM983A, characterized by the lack of Cav-1, and then utilized as a recipient for Cav-1 gene transduction to address a series of functional studies. The alleged yet controversial role of phospho (Ph)-Cav-1 on cell regulation was also tested by transducing the nonphosphorylatable Cav-1Y14A mutant. Wild-type Cav-1, but not mutated Cav-1Y14A, increased tumorigenicity as indicated by enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion and capacity of forming foci in semisolid medium. Accordingly, Cav-1 silencing inhibited melanoma cell growth reducing some of the typical traits of malignancy. Finally, we detected a secreted fraction of Cav-1 associated with cell released microvesicular particles able to stimulate in vitro anchorage independence, migration and invasion in a paracrine/autocrine fashion and, more important, competent to convey metastatic asset from the donor melanoma to the less aggressive recipient cell line. A direct correlation between Cav-1 levels, the amount of microvesicles released in the culture medium and MMP-9 expression was also observed."
25061102,"The neural crest is a multipotent, highly migratory cell population that gives rise to diverse cell types, including melanocytes. Factors regulating the development of the neural crest and emigration of its cells are likely to influence melanoma metastasis. The transcription factor FOXD3 plays an essential role in premigratory neural crest development and has been implicated in melanoma cell dormancy and response to therapeutics. FOXD3 is downregulated during the migration of the melanocyte lineage from the neural crest, and our previous work supports a role for FOXD3 in suppressing melanoma cell migration and invasion. Alternatively, TWIST1 is known to have promigratory and proinvasive roles in a number of cancers, including melanoma. Using ChIP-seq analysis, TWIST1 was identified as a potential transcriptional target of FOXD3. Mechanistically, FOXD3 directly binds to regions of the TWIST1 gene locus, leading to transcriptional repression of TWIST1 in human mutant BRAF melanoma cells. In addition, depletion of endogenous FOXD3 promotes upregulation of TWIST1 transcripts and protein. Finally, FOXD3 expression leads to a significant decrease in cell migration that can be efficiently reversed by the overexpression of TWIST1. These findings uncover the novel interplay between FOXD3 and TWIST1, which is likely to be important in the melanoma metastatic cascade."
15986140,"As a point of convergence for numerous oncogenic signaling pathways, STAT3 is constitutively-activated at 50 to 90% frequency in diverse human cancers, including melanoma. A critical role of STAT3 in tumor cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis and immune evasion has been recently demonstrated. STAT3 contributes to tumor cell growth by regulating the expression of genes that are involved in cell survival and proliferation. STAT3 promotes metastasis and angiogenesis by inducing expression of the metastatic gene, MMP-2, and the potent angiogenic gene, VEGF. STAT3 participates in the regulation of tumor immune evasion by inhibiting expression of proinflammatory mediators while promoting expression of immune-suppressing factors, which in turn activates STAT3 signaling in dendritic cells leading to immune tolerance. Thus, targeting STAT3 for therapy assaults cancer on multiple fronts. Many of the studies that defined STAT3's role in oncogenesis were carried out in melanoma cells and tumor models. In this review, we summarize the key role of STAT3 in cancer in general and melanoma in particular. With the emergence of small-molecule drugs that directly inhibit STAT3 or the oncogenic signaling pathways upstream of STAT3 in melanoma, a promising novel approach for melanoma therapy is emerging."
21460252,"The identification of genes that participate in melanomagenesis should suggest strategies for developing therapeutic modalities. We used a public array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) database and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses to identify the AMP kinase (AMPK)-related kinase NUAK2 as a candidate gene for melanomagenesis, and we analyzed its functions in melanoma cells. Our analyses had identified a locus at 1q32 where genomic gain is strongly associated with tumor thickness, and we used real-time qPCR analyses and regression analyses to identify NUAK2 as a candidate gene at that locus. Associations of relapse-free survival and overall survival of 92 primary melanoma patients with NUAK2 expression measured using immunohistochemistry were investigated using Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank tests, and Cox regression models. Knockdown of NUAK2 induces senescence and reduces S-phase, decreases migration, and down-regulates expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In vivo analysis demonstrated that knockdown of NUAK2 suppresses melanoma tumor growth in mice. Survival analysis showed that the risk of relapse is greater in acral melanoma patients with high levels of NUAK2 expression than in acral melanoma patients with low levels of NUAK2 expression (hazard ratio = 3.88; 95% confidence interval = 1.44-10.50; P = 0.0075). These data demonstrate that NUAK2 expression is significantly associated with the oncogenic features of melanoma cells and with the survival of acral melanoma patients. NUAK2 may provide a drug target to suppress melanoma progression. This study further supports the importance of NUAK2 in cancer development and tumor progression, while AMPK has antioncogenic properties."
25051432,"The role of PTHrP in the highly metastatic human melanoma disease is not known. This study investigates the mechanisms of action of this secreted factor through homozygous inactivation of the Pthrp gene in A375 human melanoma cells. In vitro, Pthrp-ablated cells (knockout [KO]-A375, -/-) showed decreased motility and anchorage-independent growth, rounder morphology, and a significant reduction in invasion capacity compared with nonablated A375 cells (wild-type [WT]-A375, +/+). PTHrP peptide 1-34 and conditioned medium from WT-A375 cells partially restored the invasive phenotype in KO-A375. Pthrp ablation substantially decreased actin polymerization, matrix metallopeptidase 9 expression and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. In vivo, green fluorescent protein-transduced ablated and nonablated A375 cells were injected intracardially or sc into nude mice to study proliferation and multiorgan metastasis. Dissemination of injected Pthrp-ablated cells to lung and liver was reduced by 85% and 50%, respectively, compared with nonablated controls (120 hours after injection). The number of metastatic lesions and the percentage of animals with metastasis were markedly lower in mice injected with Pthrp-ablated A375, and 45% of these animals survived a 7-week period compared with 15% of mice injected with nonablated WT-A375. When mice injected with WT-A375 were treated with our blocking anti-PTHrP monoclonal antibody raised against the first 33 amino acids of human PTHrP, tumor size was decreased by more than 80% over 4 weeks and survival was significantly improved over 8 months. This study provides direct evidence of the major role for PTHrP in melanoma invasion and metastasis and suggests that agents that suppress PTHrP may be beneficial against melanoma progression."
19126397,"Loss of cKit receptor in cutaneous melanomas was attributed to the down-regulation of AP2 transcription factor. Our analysis of 27 melanoma cell lines showed no correlation between AP2 and c-kit expression. Suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of cKit down-modulation, we performed genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling and found that several miRNA species are commonly up-regulated in melanomas. Among them was mir-221, which can directly interact with c-kit 3'UTR and inhibit cKit protein translation. Observed inverse correlation of the c-kit and mir-221 expression in various melanocytic cells pointed to its involvement in regulation of cKit in melanoma. Moreover, a series of functional assays demonstrated that mir-221 could directly inhibit cKit, p27(Kip1) and, possibly, other pivotal proteins in melanoma. Collectively, the studies presented here indicate that mir-221 could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma. They also suggest that regulation of expression and functional activity of identified up-regulated miRNAs should be further studied in the context of malignant melanoma."
20177751,"It was expected that with the advent of genomics, oncology may defeat the deadliest forms of cancer including malignant melanoma, but the past years have indicated that this is not the case. Despite the stunning success of genomics in defining markers or gene signatures for breast cancer prognosis and predicting therapies, there is virtually no progression in malignant melanoma. This is happening when experimental oncology or metastasis research is using several rodent and human melanoma models, when our knowledge on the metastatic cascade is actually derived from these models. Our critical analysis of these studies revealed several factors which might be responsible for this failure. First, it is evident, that these studies must be based on rigorous sample collection and basic pathological considerations, where divergent histological types of melanoma cannot be analysed universally. Secondly, without following basic consideration of metastasis biology, the majority of these studies were rarely based on primary tumors but frequently on various types of regional metastases. Third, successful expression profiling studies on other tumors such as breast cancer, provided evidences that the homogeneity of the patient cohort at least by clinicopathological stage is a critical element when defining prognostic signatures. Four studies attempted to define the prognostic signature of skin melanoma but only one based the study on the primary tumor resulting in heterogenous signatures with a minimal overlap (MCM3 and NFKBIZ). Four study attempted to define the invasiveness-signature in the primary tumor based on thickness or growth pattern discrimination identifying a 9-gene overlap which proved to be different from the prognostic signatures. On the other hand, seven studies analyzed various types of metastatic tissues (rarely visceral-, mostly cutaneous or lymphatic metastases) to define the metastasis-signatures, again with minimal overlap (AQP3, LGALS7 and SFN). Using seven GEO-based melanoma datasets we have performed a meta-analysis of the metastasis-gene signatures using normalization protocols. This analysis identified a 350-gene signature, the core of which was a 17-gene signature characterizing locoregional metastases where the individual components occurred in 3 studies: several members of this signature were extensively studied before in context of melanoma metastasis including WNT5A, EGFR, BCL2A1 and OPN. These data suggest that only efficient inter-disciplinary collaboration throughout genomic analysis of human skin melanoma could lead to major advances in defining relevant gene-sets appropriate for clinical prognostication or revealing basic molecular pathways of melanoma progression."
12742347,"The protein encoded by the Microphthalmia gene (MITF) is a transcription factor essential for the development and survival of melanocytes. It serves as a master regulator in modulating extracellular signals. Because of its central role in melanocytes survival and to assess its potential use as a histopathological marker for melanoma, MITF expression was examined in human choroidal melanomas."
17085653,"It is well established that breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) suppresses metastasis of breast cancer in animal models without affecting the growth of the primary tumor. It has also been shown to suppress the metastasis of tumors derived from breast and melanoma cell lines. However, its clinical importance for breast cancer patients remains undetermined. This prompted us to investigate its expression level in breast cancer patients to clarify its clinical significance."
23190898,"Melanoma is an aggressive cancer that metastasizes rapidly and is refractory to conventional chemotherapies. Identifying microRNAs (miRNAs) that are responsible for this pathogenesis is therefore a promising means of developing new therapies. We identified miR-26a through microarray and quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments as an miRNA that is strongly downregulated in melanoma cell lines as compared with primary melanocytes. Treatment of cell lines with miR-26a mimic caused significant and rapid cell death compared with a negative control in most melanoma cell lines tested. In surveying targets of miR-26a, we found that protein levels of SMAD1 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1) and BAG-4/SODD were strongly decreased in sensitive cells treated with miR-26a mimic as compared with the control. The luciferase reporter assays further demonstrated that miR-26a can repress gene expression through the binding site in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of SODD (silencer of death domains). Knockdown of these proteins with small interfering RNA (siRNA) showed that SODD has an important role in protecting melanoma cells from apoptosis in most cell lines sensitive to miR-26a, whereas SMAD1 may have a minor role. Furthermore, transfecting cells with a miR-26a inhibitor increased SODD expression. Our findings indicate that miR-26a replacement is a potential therapeutic strategy for metastatic melanoma, and that SODD, in particular, is a potentially useful therapeutic target."
8344747,"Flow cytometric analysis reveals that 5 human melanoma cell lines (M14, IGR3, ME1477, JUSO, GLL19) express both alpha and beta chain of the interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta). These chains are able to specifically bind IL-2 and to form high-affinity heterodimers (IL-2R alpha beta). Analysis of poly A+ RNAs by Northern blot reveals the presence of typical transcripts for both the IL-2R alpha gene (3.6 kb) and the IL-2R beta gene (4 kb). Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction analysis allowed transcripts for the IL2R gamma (p64) gene to be detected in 3 of these melanoma cell lines (M14, IGR3, ME 1477). Incubation with human recombinant IL-2 modifies in IL-2R alpha+beta+gamma+ (M14) the expression of several surface molecules: down-regulation of ICAM-1, HLA class I and HLA-DR and up-regulation of CD44. IL-2 is also active on IL-2 alpha+beta+gamma- cell lines since it decreases ICAM-1 and HLA class-II expression at the surface of JUSO cells. Down-regulation of ICAM-1, whose expression in melanoma cells is a marker of tumor progression, is detectable within 3 hr in M14 cells and is maximal after 48 hr incubation, at IL-2 concentrations corresponding to the high-affinity heterodimers. This feature is specific since it is partially inhibited by MAbs directed against the IL-2 binding site of the IL-2R alpha (MAR93, 10T14) and IL-2R beta (MiK beta 1, TU27) chains. Our data support the notion of a direct effect of IL-2 on human melanoma cells. Modulation of the expression of surface molecules which is important for the interaction with immunocompetent cells or for tumor progression, could have a role to play during in vivo IL-2 treatment of human melanomas."
25207815,"The lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Interferon (IFN) Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4) is implicated in certain types of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with these malignancies are largely unknown. In this study, we have first profiled molecular signatures associated with IRF4 expression in associated cancers, by analyzing existing gene expression profiling datasets. Our results show that IRF4 is overexpressed in melanoma, in addition to previously reported contexts including leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma, and that IRF4 is associated with a unique gene expression pattern in each context. A pool of important genes involved in B-cell development, oncogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and cell death including BATF, LIMD1, CFLAR, PIM2, and CCND2 are common signatures associated with IRF4 in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas. We confirmed the correlation of IRF4 with LIMD1 and CFLAR in a panel of cell lines derived from lymphomas. Moreover, we profiled the IRF4 transcriptome in the context of EBV latent infection, and confirmed several genes including IFI27, IFI44, GBP1, and ARHGAP18, as well as CFLAR as novel targets for IRF4. These results provide valuable information for understanding the IRF4 regulatory network, and improve our knowledge of the unique roles of IRF4 in different hematological malignancies."
21410771,"Repeated failures in melanoma therapy made clear that the molecular mechanisms leading to melanoma are still poorly understood. In this study, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional profiles and signalling pathways associated with melanoma."
19016067,"Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is known to reduce melanoma lung metastases through various mechanisms. For the delivery of IL-18 gene into the lung, three different cationic emulsions as non-viral vectors were formulated using the same components of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP), and Tween 80 with distinct oils. By using the small particle size of physicochemically stable E3, the complex of E3/plasmid DNA encoding IL-18 (16:2.5, w/w) was transfected into lung cancer cells, and the amount of plasmid DNA transferred and the expression of both mRNA and protein for IL-18 were measured. When compared with Lipofectamine/DNA complexes, an E3/DNA complex was less toxic and induced a comparable cellular level of plasmid DNA and expression levels of both mRNA and protein for IL-18. After injecting E3/DNA complexes into mice, the distribution of plasmid DNA was the highest in the lung and the liver. Especially, the administration of E3/DNA complexes induced a more rapid and prolonged distribution of plasmid DNA encoding IL-18 into the lung than that of Lipofectamine/DNA ones. These data demonstrated that cationic emulsion E3 containing castor oil could be useful for a delivery of IL-18 gene targeting the lung as well as the liver without an additional homing device, implying a potential IL-18 delivery system for the treatment of lung cancer."
17472570,"Silencing of Wnt antagonists with aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is a common phenomenon in various human cancers. Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1) is a secreted antagonist of Wnt signaling and acts through direct binding to Wnt in the extracellular space. In this study, we tried to illuminate the impact of WIF-1 gene expression in melanoma with WIF-1 silencing by in vitro and in vivo studies. We restored the expression of WIF-1 by nonviral gene transfer with a pcDNA3.1 vector. We demonstrated inhibition of melanoma cell growth after WIF-1 restoration in colony formation and proliferation assays in vitro. In addition, the inhibitory effect was related to downregulation of Wnt signaling, which was demonstrated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Furthermore, by using a xenograft mouse model, we confirmed the effect of WIF-1 expression in suppressing tumor growth by inhibition of Wnt signaling in vivo. Our results suggest the potential for further application of WIF-1 gene therapy in melanoma with WIF-1 silencing."
20944096,"metastatic melanomas are incurable by systemic treatment and it is therefore of the highest concern to develop new therapeutic regimens. RAF kinases play a key role in the RAS-RAF-MAPK signalling pathway which mediates cellular response to growth signals. An inhibitor of the RAS-RAF-MAPK cascade, sorafenib, has shown promising therapeutic results in treatment of several types of metastatic tumours. It can be hypothesized that metastatic melanomas with activating BRAF mutation may respond to RAF kinase-blocking therapy. The objective of the study was to analyze if the activating BRAF V600E mutation is present in metastatic melanomas."
25444235,"There is growing evidence that microRNAs are important regulators of gene expression in a variety of cell types. Using immortalized cell lines and primary neural crest cell explants, we show that microRNA-211, previously implicated in the regulation of melanoma proliferation and invasiveness, promotes pigmentation in melanoblasts and melanocytes. Expression of this microRNA is regulated by the key melanocyte transcription factor MITF and regulates pigmentation by targeting the TGF-β receptor 2. Transfection with pre-miR-211 precursor molecules in melb-a and melan-a cells leads to a decrease in the expression of TGF-β receptor 2 and reduces the TGF-β signaling-mediated downregulation of two melanogenic enzymes, tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1. Conversely, downregulation of microRNA-211 using specific microRNA inhibitors has the opposite effects. It appears, therefore, that microRNA-211 serves as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling which is known to play a important roles in vivo in melanocyte stem cell maintenance and pigmentation."
18949370,"We hypothesize that dysregulated expression levels of the developmental regulatory genes in the adult body result in tumor development and malignant progression. PAX genes discovered as human orthologous genes of Drosophila 'paired' encode transcription factors, which control the expression of target genes to go on along the program of development. In this study, we first quantified expression of 9 PAX genes in human nevus pigmentosus tissues, melanoma tissues and melanoma cell lines by the real-time reverse transcription-PCR method. As a result, we found that the expression levels of PAX4 and PAX9 were extremely low in melanoma tissues and cell lines compared to nevus pigmentosus tissues. We then established melanoma cells overexpressing PAX4 and examined roles of PAX4 in cell growth. PAX4-overexpression reduced in vitro cell growth of human melanoma C8161 and MeWo cells. BrdU-uptake assay and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that the retardation of cell proliferation by PAX4-overexpression was due to decreased DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, treatment of C8161 and MeWo cells with 5-azacytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, induced the expression of PAX4, suggesting that DNA methylation repressed the PAX4 gene expression in human melanoma. These results suggest that PAX4 functions as a potent tumor suppressor."
16896043,"Germ-line mutations of CDKN2A have been identified as strong risk factors for melanoma in studies of multiple-case families. However, an assessment of their relative risk for melanoma in the general population has been difficult because they occur infrequently. We addressed this issue using a novel population-based case-control study design in which ""cases"" have incident second- or higher-order melanomas [multiple primary melanoma (MPM)] and ""controls"" have incident first primary melanoma [single primary melanoma (SPM)]. Participants were ascertained from nine geographic regions in Australia, Canada, Italy, and United States. In the 1,189 MPM cases and 2,424 SPM controls who were eligible and available for analysis, the relative risk of a subsequent melanoma among patients with functional mutations who have an existing diagnosis of melanoma, after adjustments for age, sex, center, and known phenotypic risk factors, is estimated to be 4.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-7.7). The odds ratio varied significantly depending on the type of mutation involved. The results suggest that the relative risk of mutation carriers in the population may be lower than currently believed and that different mutations on the CDKN2A gene may confer substantially different risks of melanoma."
10072444,"In the setting of familial melanoma, the presence of atypical nevi, which are the precursors of melanoma, is associated with a nearly 100% risk of developing primary melanoma by age 70. In patients with sporadic melanoma, it is estimated that 40-60% of melanomas develop in contiguous association with atypical nevi. Currently, the only way to prevent atypical nevi from progressing to melanoma is to monitor and excise them as soon as they exhibit changes in their clinical features. Activation of the transcription factor, Stat3, has been linked to abnormal cell growth and transformation as well as to interferon alpha (IFN-alpha)-mediated growth suppression in vitro."
19996561,"The effects of down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, by small interfering RNA (siRNA) against the canine Bcl-2 genes, on apoptosis were investigated by transfecting MCM-N1 (canine malignant oral melanoma cell line) cells with siRNA using cationic liposomes. The siRNA against the canine Bcl-2 genes increased the number of apoptotic cells. In addition, sequence-specific down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression was measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The siRNA directed against these genes reduced both mRNA and protein expression in the MCM-N1 cells. Our study suggests the importance of Bcl-2 in canine melanoma tumors for inducing apoptosis and reinforces using Bcl-2 as a putative therapeutic target in canine malignant melanoma tumor."
22550165,"Metastatic uveal melanoma represents the most common intraocular malignancy with very poor prognosis and no effective treatments. Oncogenic mutations in the G-protein α-subunit q and 11 have been described in about 85% of uveal melanomas and confer constitutive activation. Multiple signaling pathways are induced as a consequence of GNAQ/11 activation, which include the MEK/ERK kinase cascade. We analyzed the transcriptional profile of cell lines treated with a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor to identify gene targets of activated GNAQ and to evaluate the biologic importance of these genes in uveal melanoma."
22935333,"BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3p21. Germline BAP1 mutations have been recently associated with an increased risk of malignant mesothelioma, atypical melanocytic tumors and other neoplasms. To answer the question if different germline BAP1 mutations may predispose to a single syndrome with a wide phenotypic range or to distinct syndromes, we investigated the presence of melanocytic tumors in two unrelated families (L and W) with germline BAP1 mutations and increased risk of malignant mesothelioma."
24967732,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be implicated in the complex network of cancer including malignant melanoma and play important roles in tumorigenesis and progression. However, their functions and downstream mechanisms are largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether BRAF-activated non-coding RNA (BANCR), a novel and potential regulator of melanoma cell, participates in the proliferation of malignant melanoma and elucidate the underlying mechanism in this process. We found that BANCR was abnormally overexpressed in human malignant melanoma cell lines and tissues, and increased with tumor stages by quantitative PCR. BANCR knockdown induced by shRNA transfection significantly inhibited proliferation of tumor cells and inactivated MAPK pathway, especially by silencing the ERK1/2 and JNK component. Moreover, combination treatment of BANCR knockdown and suppression ERK1/2 or JNK (induced by specific inhibitors U0126 or SP600125 respectively) produced synergistic inhibitory effects in vitro. And the inhibitory effects induced by ERK1/2 or JNK could be rescued by BANCR overexpression. By tumorigenicity assay in BALB/c nude mice, we further found that BANCR knockdown inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In addition, patients with high expression of BANCR had a lower survival rate. Taken together, we confirmed the abnormal upregulation of a novel lncRNA, BANCR, in human malignant melanoma. BANCR was involved in melanoma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. The linkage between BANCR and MAPK pathway may provide a novel interpretation for the mechanism of proliferation regulation in malignant melanoma."
15819981,"The role of genes involved in the control of progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle in melanoma tumors in not fully known. The aim of our study was to analyse mutations in TP53, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B genes in melanoma tumors and melanoma cell lines"
18451171,"B-Raf is the most mutated gene in melanoma; however, the mechanism through which it promotes early melanomas remains uncertain. Most nevi contain activated (V600E)B-Raf but few develop into melanoma, and expression in melanocytes is inhibitory with low protein levels present in surviving cells, suggesting unknown cooperative oncogenic events are necessary for melanoma development. Because many melanomas have (V600E)B-Raf and active Akt3, it is possible that these proteins cooperatively facilitate melanocyte transformation. In this study, Akt3 is shown to phosphorylate (V600E)B-Raf to lower its activity as well as that of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to levels promoting early melanoma development. Expression of active Akt3 in early melanoma cells containing (V600E)B-Raf reduced MAPK signaling and promoted anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, expression of both (V600E)B-Raf and active Akt3 in melanocytes promoted a transformed phenotype. Mechanistically, aberrant Akt3 activity in early melanomas serves to phosphorylate Ser(364) and Ser(428) on (V600E)B-Raf to reduce activity of (V600E)B-Raf to levels that promote rather than inhibit proliferation, which aids melanocytic transformation. Inhibition of (V600E)B-Raf or Akt3 in advanced melanoma cells in which both pathways were active reduced anchorage-independent growth and tumor development in a cooperatively acting manner. Inhibition of Akt3 alone in these cells led to increased MAPK signaling. In summary, these results suggest that activating B-Raf mutations initially promote nevi development, but the resulting high, intense activation of the MAPK pathway inhibits further tumor progression requiring Akt3 activation to bypass this barrier and aid melanoma development."
22487681,"Melanoma tumor cells shift between proliferative and invasive states based on their plasticity and microenvironmental conditions. Our team has shown that melanoma cells, grown as spheroids in a neural cell crest medium, polarize toward an invasive phenotype, characterized by a higher motility, a poor proliferation rate and a gain of pluripotency gene expression (Nanog and Oct4) when compared with cells grown in two dimensions in a serum-contaning medium. In agreement with the phenotypic switching hypothesis, most of these features are reversible. Microarray studies comparing two- vs. three-dimensional cultures revealed the downregulation of a polycomb-like protein, PHF19 (PHD finger protein 19), in the spheroids. As Polycomb proteins are involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression, we hypothesized that PHF19 might play a role in the switch between proliferative and invasive phenotypes. In this report, we show that PHF19 silencing reduces the cell proliferation rate and increases the transendothelial migration capacities of melanoma cell lines. However, PHF19 does not modulate the transcription level of Oct4 and Nanog. In the search of an upstream transcriptional regulator of the above genes, we identified the Akt signaling cascade as an inhibitor of Oct4 and Nanog expression and an activator for PHF19 expression. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, we further provide evidence that phospho-Akt is part of the transcriptional complex associated to the promoters of all three genes. Our data therefore indicate the role of PHF19 and its upstream regulator, Akt, in the phenotype switch of melanoma cells from proliferative to invasive states."
25823659,"Invasive malignant melanoma (MM) is an aggressive tumor with no curative therapy available in advanced stages. Nuclear corepressor (NCoR) is an essential regulator of gene transcription, and its function has been found deregulated in different types of cancer. In colorectal cancer cells, loss of nuclear NCoR is induced by Inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK) through the phosphorylation of specific serine residues. We here investigate whether NCoR function impacts in MM, which might have important diagnostic and prognostic significance. By IHC, we here determined the subcellular distribution of NCoR in a cohort of 63 primary invasive MM samples, and analyzed its possible correlation with specific clinical parameters. We therefore used a microarray-based strategy to determine global gene expression differences in samples with similar tumor stage, which differ in the presence of cytoplasmic or nuclear NCoR. We found that loss of nuclear NCoR results in upregulation of a specific cancer-related genetic signature, and is significantly associated with MM progression. Inhibition of IKK activity in melanoma cells reverts NCoR nuclear distribution and specific NCoR-regulated gene transcription. Analysis of public database demonstrated that inactivating NCoR mutations are highly prevalent in MM, showing features of driver oncogene."
24935963,"Germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CDKN2A occur in 5-20% of familial melanoma cases. A single founder mutation, p.Arg112dup, accounts for the majority of CDKN2A mutations in Swedish carriers. In a national program, carriers of p.Arg112dup mutation have been identified. The aim of this study was to assess cancer risks in p.Arg112dup carriers and their first degree relatives (FDRs) and second degree relatives (SDRs)."
25588203,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is an intraocular malignant tumor in adults that is characterized by rapid progression and recurrence. Irradiation has become the primary therapy for UM patients who are not candidates for surgery. However, after large-dose fraction irradiation treatment, some patients undergo subsequent enucleation because of radiotherapy-related complications. This situation has raised concerns on how to optimize the effectiveness of radiation treatment. Recent investigations of microRNAs are changing our understanding of UM tumor biology and are helping to identify novel targets for radiotherapy. The radioresistant UM cell lines OM431 and OCM1 were selected and exposed to irradiation, and let-7b was found to be downregulated after exposure. We then confirmed that let-7b mimics could inhibit UM growth both in vitro and in vivo. More specifically, transfection with let-7b mimics markedly resensitized OCM1 and OM431 cells to irradiation by reducing the population of S-phase cells. Cyclin D1 plays a vital role in cell cycle arrest, which is induced by let-7b overexpression. Cyclin D1 is also a target of let-7b and its expression is suppressed by upregulation of let-7b. Collectively, our results indicate that let-7b overexpression can in turn downregulate cyclin D1 expression and enhance the radiosensitivity of UM through cell cycle arrest. Let-7b could serve as a marker for radiosensitivity and could enhance the therapeutic benefit of UM cell irradiation."
19207948,"Anorectal melanoma (AM) forms a rare but highly malignant subset of mucosal melanoma with an extremely poor prognosis. Although AMs display histological and immunohistochemical features very similar to cutaneous melanoma (CM), no association exists either with exposure to ultraviolet light or with melanocytic naevi. While AMs are clearly distinguished from CM by displaying few BRAF mutations, they are commonly indistinguishable from CM at the level of gene expression. The aim was to carry out expression analyses of classical immunohistochemical markers and of the protein deleted in malignant brain tumours 1 (DMBT1) in cases of primary anorectal malignant melanoma and CM."
25124714,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare ocular tumor that may lead to deadly metastases in 50% of patients. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)10, ADAM17, and the HGF-receptor c-Met support invasiveness in different tumors. Here, we report that high ADAM10, MET, and, to a lesser extent, ADAM17 gene expression correlates with poor progression-free survival in UM patients (hazard ratio 2.7, 2.6, and 1.9, respectively). About 60% of primary UM expresses c-Met and/or ADAM10 proteins. Four UM cell lines display high levels of ADAM10 and ADAM17, which constitutively cleave c-Met, inducing the release of soluble c-Met. ADAM10/17 pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing reduces c-Met shedding, but has limited impact on surface c-Met, which is overexpressed. Importantly, ADAM10 silencing inhibits UM cell invasion driven by FCS or HGF, while ADAM17 silencing has a limited effect. Altogether our data indicate that ADAM10 has a pro-invasive role and may contribute to UM progression."
12384558,"To identify molecules involved in the progression of human melanoma to metastatic disease, autologous primary and metastatic melanoma cells were compared by differential mRNA display. One cDNA, expressed in primary but not in autologous metastatic cells in three different patients, was cloned and characterized, and shown to be the human homologue of the inducible, immediate early TDAG51/PHLDA1 (pleckstrin-homology-like domain family A, member1) gene. Monoclonal antibodies produced against the PHLDA1 protein revealed homogeneous strong expression by benign melanocytic nevi, and progressively reduced expression in primary and metastatic melanomas in vivo. Analysis of stable cDNA transfectants in two different cell lines revealed that constitutive PHLDA1 expression is associated with reduced cell growth, cloning efficiency, and colony formation but not with alterations in cell cycle parameters. However, PHLDA1 expression was associated with increased basal apoptosis as assessed by live cell annexin V binding, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-dependent nucleotide incorporation, and with increased cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-9. Constitutive PHLDA1 expression greatly enhances the sensitivity of human melanoma cells to the chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin and camptothecin. These results suggest that PHLDA1 is constitutively expressed by melanocytic nevi where it may contribute to their benign phenotype. The progressive loss of PHLDA1 expression in melanomas may play a role in deregulated cell growth and apoptosis resistance in these tumors."
26498684,"CDKN2A/p16INK4a is an essential tumor suppressor gene that controls cell cycle progression and replicative senescence. It is also the main melanoma susceptibility gene. Here we report that p16INK4a 5'UTR mRNA acts as a cellular Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). The potential for p16INK4a 5'UTR to drive cap-independent translation was evaluated by dual-luciferase assays using bicistronic and monocistronic vectors. Results of reporters' relative activities coupled to control analyses for actual bicistronic mRNA transcription, indicated that the wild type p16INK4a 5'UTR could stimulate cap-independent translation. Notably, hypoxic stress and the treatment with mTOR inhibitors enhanced the translation-stimulating property of p16INK4a 5'UTR. RNA immunoprecipitation performed in melanoma-derived SK-Mel-28 and in a patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell line indicated that YBX1 can bind the wild type p16INK4a mRNA increasing its translation efficiency, particularly during hypoxic stress. Modulation of YBX1 expression further supported its involvement in cap-independent translation of the wild type p16INK4a but not a c.-42T>A variant. RNA SHAPE assays revealed local flexibility changes for the c.-42T>A variant at the predicted YBX1 binding site region. Our results indicate that p16INK4a 5'UTR contains a cellular IRES that can enhance mRNA translation efficiency, in part through YBX1."
24346768,"Cancer is a genomic disease associated with a plethora of gene mutations resulting in a loss of control over vital cellular functions. Among these mutated genes, driver genes are defined as being causally linked to oncogenesis, while passenger genes are thought to be irrelevant for cancer development. With increasing numbers of large-scale genomic datasets available, integrating these genomic data to identify driver genes from aberration regions of cancer genomes becomes an important goal of cancer genome analysis and investigations into mechanisms responsible for cancer development. A computational method, MAXDRIVER, is proposed here to identify potential driver genes on the basis of copy number aberration (CNA) regions of cancer genomes, by integrating publicly available human genomic data. MAXDRIVER employs several optimization strategies to construct a heterogeneous network, by means of combining a fused gene functional similarity network, gene-disease associations and a disease phenotypic similarity network. MAXDRIVER was validated to effectively recall known associations among genes and cancers. Previously identified as well as novel driver genes were detected by scanning CNAs of breast cancer, melanoma and liver carcinoma. Three predicted driver genes (CDKN2A, AKT1, RNF139) were found common in these three cancers by comparative analysis."
19040420,"p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22 (PERP) is a transcriptional target gene of p53 tumour suppressor that is specifically induced during apoptosis and not during cell cycle arrest. In primary uveal melanoma (UM), the most common intraocular malignancy in adults that has a reportedly unaffected signalling pathway upstream of and including p53, PERP expression is down-regulated in the metastatic monosomy 3-type tumours, compared with the less aggressive disomy 3-type tumours. Here, we demonstrate experimentally, by the use of full-length PERP-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions and real-time confocal microscopy, the intracellular targeting and plasma membrane localization of PERP in living UM cells and show that expression of PERP induces caspase-mediated apoptosis in UM cells. Induction of PERP expression in GFP-PERP-transfected UM cells leads to increased levels of cleaved caspase-8 forms, as well as to reduction of its full-length substrate Bid, but not to detectable processing of caspase-9. The levels of mature caspase-8, -9 and -3 proteins significantly correlate with PERP expression levels in primary UMs. Transcriptional profiling of PERP and caspase-8 in tumour specimens indicates that the positive association of PERP and caspase-8 proteins is a consequence of post-translational processing, most likely at the level of caspase-8 cleavage, and not of increased transcription of pro-caspase-8. We conclude that PERP expression leads to activation of an extrinsic receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, with a possible subsequent engagement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The findings underline the apoptotic pathway mediated by PERP as a critical mechanism employed by UM tumours to modulate susceptibility to apoptosis."
19338054,"The melanocortin 1 receptor, a Gs protein-coupled receptor expressed in epidermal melanocytes, is a major determinant of skin pigmentation and phototype and an important contributor to melanoma risk. MC1R activation stimulates synthesis of black, strongly photoprotective eumelanin pigments. Several MC1R alleles are associated with red hair, fair skin, increased sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, and increased skin cancer risk. The MC1R gene is highly polymorphic, but only a few naturally occurring alleles have been functionally characterized, which complicates the establishment of accurate correlations between the signaling properties of mutant alleles and defined cutaneous phenotypes. We report the functional characterization of six MC1R alleles found in Spanish melanoma patients. Two variants (c.152T>C, p.Val51Ala and c.865T>C, p.Cys289Arg) have never been described, and the others (c.112G>A, p.Val38Met; c.122C>T, p.Ser41Phe; c.383T>C, p.Met128Thr; and c.842A>G, p.Asn281Ser) have not been analyzed for function. p.Asn281Ser corresponds to a functionally silent polymorphism. The other mutations are associated with varying degrees of loss of function (LOF), from moderate decreases in coupling to the cAMP pathway (p.Val38Met and p.Val51Ala) to nearly complete absence of functional coupling (p.Ser41Phe, p.Met128Thr, and p.Cys289Arg). The LOF p.Met128Thr and p.Cys289Arg mutants are trafficked to the cell surface, but are unable to bind agonists efficiently. Conversely, LOF of p.Val38Met, p.Ser41Phe, and p.Val51Ala is due to reduced cell surface expression as a consequence of retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, LOF of MC1R alleles is frequently associated with aberrant forward trafficking and accumulation within the ER or with inability to bind properly the activatory ligand."
20337985,"POU3F2 is a POU-Homeodomain transcription factor expressed in neurons and melanoma cells. In melanoma lesions, cells expressing high levels of POU3F2 show enhanced invasive and metastatic capacity that can in part be explained by repression of Micropthalmia-associated Transcription Factor (MITF) expression via POU3F2 binding to its promoter. To identify other POU3F2 target genes that may be involved in modulating the properties of melanoma cells, we performed ChIP-chip experiments in 501Mel melanoma cells. 2108 binding loci located in the regulatory regions of 1700 potential target genes were identified. Bioinformatic and experimental assays showed the presence of known POU3F2-binding motifs, but also many AT-rich sequences with only partial similarity to the known motifs at the occupied loci. Functional analysis indicates that POU3F2 regulates the stem cell factor (Kit ligand, Kitl) promoter via a cluster of four closely spaced binding sites located in the proximal promoter. Our results suggest that POU3F2 may regulate the properties of melanoma cells via autocrine KIT ligand signalling."
24260410,"WNT5A, a member of the WNT family of secreted lipid-modified glycoproteins, is a critical regulator of a host of developmental processes, including limb formation, lung morphogenesis, intestinal elongation and mammary gland development. Altered WNT5A expression has been associated with a number of cancers. Interestingly, in certain types of cancers, such as hematological malignancies and colorectal carcinoma, WNT5A is inactivated and exerts a tumor suppressive function, while in other cancers, such as melanoma and gastric carcinoma, WNT5A is overexpressed and promotes tumor progression. The mechanism by which WNT5A achieves these distinct activities in cancers is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that the WNT5A gene produces two protein isoforms, WNT5A-long (WNT5A-L) and WNT5A-short (WNT5A-S). Amino-terminal sequencing and a WNT5A-L specific antibody demonstrate that the mature and secreted isoforms are distinct, with WNT5A-L carrying an additional 18 N-terminal amino acids. Biochemical analysis indicates that both purified proteins are similar with respect to their stability, hydrophobicity and WNT/β-catenin signaling activity. Nonetheless, modulation of these two WNT5A isoforms, either through ectopic expression or knockdown, demonstrates that they exert distinct activities in cancer cell lines: while WNT5A-L inhibits proliferation of tumor cell lines, WNT5A-S promotes their growth. Finally, we show that expression of these two WNT5A isoforms is altered in breast and cervix carcinomas, as well as in the most aggressive neuroblastoma tumors. In these cancers, WNT5A-L is frequently down-regulated, whereas WNT5A-S is found overexpressed in a significant fraction of tumors. Altogether, our study provides evidence that the distinct activities of WNT5A in cancer can be attributed to the production of two WNT5A isoforms."
10867810,"Apoptosis is an important cofactor in the pathogenesis of a plethora of malignancies. However, little is known about modulation of the expression of bcl gene family in melanocytic tumors. To determine the role of bcl-2, bcl-x and bax in melanocytic tumors we investigated the differential expression of these genes via RT-PCR in tissue samples from human benign nevi, primary melanomas and melanoma metastases in comparison with normal skin. Bcl-2 was strongly expressed in 14/16 metastases (87.5%), whereas only 7/13 primary melanomas (53%), 7/15 nevi (46%) and 7/16 normal tissue samples (43%) showed expression of bcl-2 (P < 0.05). There was a strong indication of a correlation between tumor thickness and bcl-2 expression in nodular malignant melanomas. Expression of bcl-x was found in 16/16 melanoma metastases (100%), 11/13 primary melanomas (84%), 12/15 nevi (80%) and 10/16 normal tissue samples (62%) (P < 0.05). Bcl-xL expression increased from primary melanoma to melanoma metastases, whereas bcl-xS showed a decreasing expression level during melanoma progression. No differences in bax expression were seen between melanoma metastases, primary melanoma, nevi and normal tissue. Immunohistochemical investigations of another 53 tissue samples showed similar results. Our results strongly indicate that bcl-2 and bcl-xL gene expression increases with progression of malignant melanoma. Bcl-2 and bcl-xL expression could reflect an increased malignant potential caused by an inhibition of apoptosis and growth advantage for metastatic melanoma cells."
21072599,"A high frequency of somatic mutation in GNAQ has been reported in uveal melanoma (UM). GNAQ is located in the chromosomal band 9q21, the same chromosomal band that harbors a putative candidate gene for hereditary UM. We investigated the frequency of germline sequence alterations in the GNAQ gene in UM patients with increased predisposition to hereditary cancer. A total of 44 high risk UM patients were studied including three patients with a family history of UM, 15 patients with a family history of cutaneous melanoma (CM), three patients with early age at onset of their UM (<30 years) and 23 patients with strong family history of cancer and/or personal history of multiple primary tumors. Mutational screening of the seven exons of GNAQ and nearby intronic sequence was carried out by direct sequencing. We identified two deep intronic variants but no potential pathogenic mutations in GNAQ. Our results exclude GNAQ as a candidate gene in UM patients with a high risk for hereditary cancer predisposition."
26396549,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still one of the deadliest cancer-related diseases. About 10% of CRC patients are characterized by a mutation in the B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) gene resulting in a valine-to-glutamate change at the residue 600 (V600E). This mutation is also present in more than 60% of melanoma patients. BRAF inhibitors were developed and found to improve patient survival; however, most patients at the end of the track ultimately develop resistance to these inhibitors. Melanoma patients benefit from the combination of BRAF inhibitors with mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors, among others. Unfortunately, colorectal patients do not respond much efficiently, which suggests different resistance mechanisms between the two cancer types. This review aims at shedding light on recent discoveries that improve our understanding of the BRAF mutation biology in CRC."
23416158,"BRAF is the most mutated gene in melanoma, with approximately 50% of patients containing V600E mutant protein. (V600E)B-RAF can be targeted using pharmacological agents, but resistance develops in patients by activating other proteins in the signaling pathway. Identifying downstream members in this signaling cascade is important to design strategies to avoid the development of resistance. Unfortunately, downstream proteins remain to be identified and therapeutic potential requires validation. A kinase screen was undertaken to identify downstream targets in the (V600E)B-RAF signaling cascade. Involvement of aurora kinase B (AURKB) and Wee1-like protein kinase (WEE1) as downstream proteins in the (V600E)B-RAF pathway was validated in xenografted tumors, and mechanisms of action were characterized in size- and time-matched tumors. Levels of only AURKB and WEE1 decreased in melanoma cells, when (V600E)B-RAF, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 protein levels were reduced using siRNA compared with other identified kinases. AURKB and WEE1 were expressed in tumors of patients with melanoma at higher levels than observed in normal human melanocytes. Targeting these proteins reduced tumor development by approximately 70%, similar to that observed when inhibiting (V600E)B-RAF. Furthermore, protein or activity levels of AURKB and WEE1 decreased in melanoma cells when pharmacological agents targeting upstream (V600E)B-RAF or mitogen-activated protein kinase were used to inhibit the (V600E)B-RAF pathway. Thus, AURKB and WEE1 are targets and biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy, lying downstream of (V600E)B-RAF in melanomas."
21722328,"Increased expression of DNA repair genes contributes to the extreme resistance shown by melanoma to conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. One such chemotherapeutic effective against a range of other cancers, but not melanoma, is cisplatin. The DNA repair protein, ERCC1, is needed to remove cisplatin-induced DNA damage. We have shown that ERCC1 is essential for melanoma growth and resistance to cisplatin in a mouse xenograft model. Untreated xenografts of our transformed Ercc1-proficient melanocyte cell line grew very rapidly as malignant melanoma. Cisplatin treatment caused initial shrinkage of xenografts, but cisplatin-resistant regrowth soon followed. Cells reisolated into culture had twofold elevated levels of ERCC1 compared to both input cells and cells reisolated from untreated xenografts. An isogenic Ercc1-deficient derivative grew equally well in vitro as the Ercc1-proficient melanocyte cell line. However, in xenografts, the Ercc1-deficient melanomas were much slower to establish and were completely cured by just two cisplatin treatments."
15756009,"Up to half of uveal melanoma patients die of metastatic disease. Treatment of the primary eye tumor does not improve survival in high-risk patients due to occult micrometastatic disease, which is present at the time of eye tumor diagnosis but is not detected and treated until months to years later. Here, we use microarray gene expression data to identify a new prognostic marker."
14714570,"Microsatellite instability and reduced expression of mismatch repair proteins were reported in melanomas. However, little is known about mutational changes of the mismatch repair genes in radial growth-phase melanoma especially following UVB irradiation. To investigate these changes, an in vitro system consisting of radial growth-phase Wistar melanoma cell lines (WM35, WM3211 and WM1650) was established. The cells were UVB irradiated (10 mJ/cm(2)), and evaluated for mutational changes of exon regions 13,16 and 19 (hMLH1) and 6,7 and 12 (hMLH2) of these genes before and after irradiation. The genomic DNAs were PCR amplified and the products were directly sequenced. Transition (C-->T, G-->A, T-->C) and transversion (G-->, A-->T) mutations were found in exons 6,16 and 19. Some were present in both the sham-irradiated and UV-irradiated cells but others were only detected after UVB irradiation. hMLH1 and hMLH2 gene mutations occur early in melanoma tumorigenesis. The ability of UVB irradiation to induce additional mutations in these repair genes suggests its possible role in melanoma pathogenesis. Further investigation will be needed to determine whether mutations such as these contribute to the development of microsatellite instability in melanoma."
14961576,"Ras signaling is important for the intracellular transduction of mitogenic stimuli from activated growth factor receptors. We have investigated 37 sporadic malignant melanomas (15 primary cutaneous melanomas and 22 melanoma metastases) and 6 melanoma cell lines for mutations in the 3 Ras genes NRAS, KRAS and HRAS. All tumors and cell lines were additionally analyzed for mutation and expression of BRAF, which encodes a Ras-regulated serine/threonine kinase with oncogenic properties, as well as for expression of RASSF1A, which encodes a Ras-binding protein with tumor suppressor properties. Mutational analyses identified somatic NRAS mutations in 2 primary melanomas, 4 melanoma metastases and 2 cell lines. One melanoma metastasis showed a somatic KRAS mutation whereas HRAS mutations were not detected. Eight primary melanomas, 6 melanoma metastases and 4 melanoma cell lines carried BRAF mutations affecting the known hot-spot codon 599. None of the tumors or cell lines with BRAF mutation demonstrated NRAS or KRAS mutations. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR showed that 8 melanomas (3 primary tumors, 5 melanoma metastases) had reduced RASSF1A transcript levels of < or =50% relative to benign melanocytic nevi and normal skin. Three melanoma cell lines lacked detectable RASSF1A transcripts. The RASSF1A gene promoter was hypermethylated in these 3 cell lines as well as in 6 of 8 melanomas with reduced RASSF1A mRNA levels. Treatment of the cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A resulted in demethylation of the RASSF1A promoter and re-expression of RASSF1A transcripts. Most tumors and all cell lines with RASSF1A promoter methylation additionally carried BRAF or NRAS mutations, suggesting a synergistic effect of these aberrations on melanoma growth. Taken together, 57% of the investigated melanomas and 100% of the melanoma cell lines carried mutations in either NRAS, KRAS or BRAF. In addition, 22% of the melanomas and 50% of the cell lines showed reduced RASSF1A transcript levels. Thus, alterations of Ras pathway genes are of paramount importance in the pathogenesis of sporadic melanomas."
17197349,"The protein product of nm23-H1 gene has activity of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside triphosphates. Reductions in nm23 expression have been significantly associated with aggressive behavior in melanoma, breast, colon, and gastric carcinomas. On the contrary, high levels of nm23 gene expression are noted in the advanced stage of thyroid carcinomas and associated with significant reductions in survival for neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma patients. Although expression of nm23/NDP kinase is divergent in various malignant tumors, its reduced expression seems to be related to increased metastatic potential in most carcinoma types. However, it is hypothesized that nm23 may play a tissue-specific role, and that different regulatory mechanisms may act in different tumors. In ovarian carcinoma, nm23-H1/NDP kinase may be correlated with some clinicopathologic characteristics. In cervical cancer, nm23-H1 is probably involved in cervical carcinogenesis and correlated with some aggressive parameters. Overexpression of nm23-H1 protein may indicate poor survival for cervical cancer patients. Other than histidine 118 residue (amino acid sequence 118: histidine) concerned with NDP kinase activity of nm23-H1, serine 120 (amino acid sequence 120: serine) related activity of histidine-dependent protein phosphotransfer was recently reported to be responsible for its biological suppressive effects. To inhibit metastatic potential, nm23-H1 is also demonstrated to co-immunoprecipitate the kinase suppressor of Ras and phosphorylate it, and therefore reduce activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in response to signaling."
24993904,"The existence of a ""metastasis gene signature"" that predisposes primary breast cancer cells to metastasize to the lungs has been recently highlighted by gene expression profiling studies. The combination of genes responsible for this process includes genes encoding several metalloproteinases as well as the gene encoding SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine)/osteonectin. SPARC is involved in normal tissue remodeling as it regulates the deposition of extracellular matrix, but also plays a role in neoplastic transformation. Aberrant SPARC expression has been detected both in stromal cells associated with cancer and in cancer cells. The main aim of this study was to investigate whether or not SPARC might be involved in directing metastasis of other types of cancer to the lung. We constructed a tissue microarray containing lung metastases from a variety of primary tumors in different organs and used immunohistochemistry to assess SPARC expression. We found SPARC overexpressed mainly in lung metastases from melanoma. We then assessed the expression of SPARC mRNA and protein in metastatic melanoma from different anatomic sites and in their corresponding primary tumors, and found that it is overexpressed in lung metastases. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that SPARC is involved in directing melanoma metastases specifically to the lung, which underpins its potential as prognostic marker and novel target for specific therapy."
20709760,"Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is the main structural component of caveolae, which are plasma membrane invaginations that participate in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction events. Although evidence describing the function of CAV1 in several cancer types has recently accumulated, its role in melanoma tumor formation and progression remains poorly explored. Here, by using B16F10 melanoma cells as an experimental system, we directly explore the function of CAV1 in melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. We first show that CAV1 expression promotes proliferation, whereas it suppresses migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro. When orthotopically implanted in the skin of mice, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 form tumors that are similar in size to their control counterparts. An experimental metastasis assay shows that CAV1 expression suppresses the ability of B16F10 cells to form lung metastases in C57Bl/6 syngeneic mice. Additionally, CAV1 protein and mRNA levels are found to be significantly reduced in human metastatic melanoma cell lines and human tissue from metastatic lesions. Finally, we show that following integrin activation, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 display reduced expression levels and activity of FAK and Src proteins. Furthermore, CAV1 expression markedly reduces the expression of integrin β(3) in B16F10 melanoma cells. In summary, our findings provide experimental evidence that CAV1 may function as an antimetastatic gene in malignant melanoma."
21435193,"To identify microRNAs potentially involved in melanomagenesis, we compared microRNA expression profiles between melanoma cell lines and cultured melanocytes. The most differentially expressed microRNA between the normal and tumor cell lines was miR-211. We focused on this pigment-cell-enriched miRNA as it is derived from the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-regulated gene, TRPM1 (melastatin). We find that miR-211 expression is greatly decreased in melanoma cells and melanoblasts compared to melanocytes. Bioinformatic analysis identified a large number of potential targets of miR-211, including POU3F2 (BRN2). Inhibition of miR-211 in normal melanocytes resulted in increased BRN2 protein, indicating that endogenous miR-211 represses BRN2 in differentiated cells. Over-expression of miR-211 in melanoma cell lines changed the invasive potential of the cells in vitro through directly targeting BRN2 translation. We propose a model for the apparent non-overlapping expression levels of BRN2 and MITF in melanoma, mediated by miR-211 expression."
16410717,"Numerous BRAF mutations have been detected in melanoma biopsy specimens and cell lines. In contrast, several studies report lack of BRAF mutations in uveal melanoma including primary and metastatic choroidal and ciliary body melanomas. To our knowledge, for the first time, here we report a case of choroidal melanoma harboring the BRAF mutation (V600E). The activation of RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, although independent of BRAF mutation, was reported in uveal melanoma. The presence of V600E mutation indicates that the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, in addition to cutaneous melanoma progression, may play a role in the choroidal melanoma development."
22080950,"So far, two genes associated with familial melanoma have been identified, accounting for a minority of genetic risk in families. Mutations in CDKN2A account for approximately 40% of familial cases, and predisposing mutations in CDK4 have been reported in a very small number of melanoma kindreds. Here we report the whole-genome sequencing of probands from several melanoma families, which we performed in order to identify other genes associated with familial melanoma. We identify one individual carrying a novel germline variant (coding DNA sequence c.G1075A; protein sequence p.E318K; rs149617956) in the melanoma-lineage-specific oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Although the variant co-segregated with melanoma in some but not all cases in the family, linkage analysis of 31 families subsequently identified to carry the variant generated a log of odds (lod) score of 2.7 under a dominant model, indicating E318K as a possible intermediate risk variant. Consistent with this, the E318K variant was significantly associated with melanoma in a large Australian case-control sample. Likewise, it was similarly associated in an independent case-control sample from the United Kingdom. In the Australian sample, the variant allele was significantly over-represented in cases with a family history of melanoma, multiple primary melanomas, or both. The variant allele was also associated with increased naevus count and non-blue eye colour. Functional analysis of E318K showed that MITF encoded by the variant allele had impaired sumoylation and differentially regulated several MITF targets. These data indicate that MITF is a melanoma-predisposition gene and highlight the utility of whole-genome sequencing to identify novel rare variants associated with disease susceptibility."
24359286,"It is currently not possible to predict the metastatic potential of early-stage melanoma lesions by histological examination alone; however, a significant number of thin melanomas will progress over time to advanced disease. Molecular biomarkers that could identify patients with melanoma at high risk at the time of original diagnosis would contribute significantly to improved patient outcomes and increased survival. Neuropilin-2 (NRP2), a cell surface receptor involved in tumour-associated angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, has recently been shown to be expressed in melanoma."
17594688,"Copy number alterations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been extensively analyzed in different cancers, but no data are available for primary malignant melanoma. The aim of the present study was to simultaneously investigate the EGFR gene and chromosome 7 copy number alterations in 81 cutaneous malignant melanomas by interphase FISH and correlate the data with clinicopathological parameters of patients. EGFR mRNA levels were detected by Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays for 16 lesions. Both increased gene dosage and chromosome 7 alterations were found in 70% of tumors. Extra EGFR copies were detected in an additional 10% of samples. Polysomy 7 was associated with EGFR gene amplification. Significant correlation was found between EGFR alterations and histological subtypes, tumor thickness, ulceration and metastases formation. Amplification was significantly higher in lesions that developed metastases within 2 years after surgical excision of the primary tumor. Gene copy alterations were associated with elevated mRNA expression in 77% of lesions when compared to tumors with disomic EGFR status, the correlation was not directly proportional to gene copy number. Associations between protein expression and mRNA levels were even less prominent. In conclusion, our study indicates that amplification of the EGFR gene and polysomy 7 are frequent alterations in primary melanomas and are associated with bad prognosis. Further studies are required to clarify whether melanoma patients with EGFR alterations can benefit from anti-EGFR therapy."
21072171,"The immediate molecular mechanisms behind invasive melanoma are poorly understood. Recent studies implicate microRNAs (miRNAs) as important agents in melanoma and other cancers. To investigate the role of miRNAs in melanoma, we subjected human melanoma cell lines to miRNA expression profiling, and report a range of variations in several miRNAs. Specifically, compared with expression levels in melanocytes, levels of miR-211 were consistently reduced in all eight non-pigmented melanoma cell lines we examined; they were also reduced in 21 out of 30 distinct melanoma samples from patients, classified as primary in situ, regional metastatic, distant metastatic, and nodal metastatic. The levels of several predicted target mRNAs of miR-211 were reduced in melanoma cell lines that ectopically expressed miR-211. In vivo target cleavage assays confirmed one such target mRNA encoded by KCNMA1. Mutating the miR-211 binding site seed sequences at the KCNMA1 3'-UTR abolished target cleavage. KCNMA1 mRNA and protein expression levels varied inversely with miR-211 levels. Two different melanoma cell lines ectopically expressing miR-211 exhibited significant growth inhibition and reduced invasiveness compared with the respective parental melanoma cell lines. An shRNA against KCNMA1 mRNA also demonstrated similar effects on melanoma cells. miR-211 is encoded within the sixth intron of TRPM1, a candidate suppressor of melanoma metastasis. The transcription factor MITF, important for melanocyte development and function, is needed for high TRPM1 expression. MITF is also needed for miR-211 expression, suggesting that the tumor-suppressor activities of MITF and/or TRPM1 may at least partially be due to miR-211's negative post transcriptional effects on the KCNMA1 transcript. Given previous reports of high KCNMA1 levels in metastasizing melanoma, prostate cancer and glioma, our findings that miR-211 is a direct posttranscriptional regulator of KCNMA1 expression as well as the dependence of this miRNA's expression on MITF activity, establishes miR-211 as an important regulatory agent in human melanoma."
21325067,"KIT aberrations were described in acral and mucosal melanomas in largely Caucasian populations. Asian populations are more prone to develop acral and mucosal than cutaneous melanomas, and may harbor a high frequency of KIT aberrations."
19671763,"Point mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently been identified in mucosal, acral lentiginous, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas. We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous, chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas."
9806478,"Approximately ten percent of patients with malignant melanoma have family histories of the disease, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Germline mutations in tumour suppressor p16 gene have been implicated as disease causing mutations in some of the melanoma families. The frequency of families with p16 germline mutations among melanoma prone families varies from eight to fifty percent. The range of the variability is influenced apparently by the number of melanoma affected individuals within the family, as well as by other, yet unidentified factors. Ethnic background is known to determine both the frequency and the nature of germline alterations. Recently, specific mutations in tumour suppressor genes involved in breast cancer and in colon cancer were found at elevated frequency among Ashkenazi Jews. This report describes results of a screening for p16 germline alterations in a collection of Israeli melanoma families. We have analyzed genomic DNA from thirty one Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jewish melanoma families, as well as from thirty melanoma patients without an apparent family history of the disease. The entire coding region of the p16 gene was screened by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. We have detected a number of carriers with the Ala148 Thr polymorphism at the end of the second exon and several instances of 500(G=>C) substitution at the 3' untranslated portion of the gene."
16432463,"We examined the relation between cutaneous melanoma risk and the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms G241R and K469E, as well as the circulating soluble form of ICAM-1 determined in plasma, in the population of Modena Province, northern Italy. Individuals carrying at least one R241 allele, versus those carrying the wild-type GG genotype, had a relative risk of melanoma of 4.3 (P = 0.022), whereas the K469E polymorphism was unrelated to disease risk. Soluble ICAM-1 levels above 10 ng/ml directly and strongly correlated with melanoma risk. In this population, individuals carrying the R241 allele of the ICAM-1 gene appeared to show an enhanced susceptibility to cutaneous melanoma, possibly because of increased ICAM-1 expression."

14719109,"p16INK4a gene mapped at chromosome 9p21 region encodes a tumor suppressor protein p16 which is frequently inactivated in human cancers, including skin melanoma. In order to clarify the importance of p16 alterations in melanoma, we examined the deletions of p16INK4a and expression of p16 protein in eight unselected primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines from human skin melanomas. Normal skin melanocytes were used as controls. Deletions of entire exons in the p16INK4a gene were detected by PCR technique and expression of the p16 protein was examined by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Results showed that the fragments from exons 2A, 2C and 3 in p16INK4a gene were totally deleted in the metastatic melanoma cell line, FM28.7 and the fragment from exon 3 was deleted in the metastatic melanoma cell line, FM55M2. P16 protein was strongly expressed in two of the primary melanomas cell lines (FM55P and RaH3). The p16 protein was weakly expressed in one of the metastatic melanoma cell lines (FM55M1) and negative in the other metastasis (FM55M2) as compared to their matched primary melanoma cells (FM55P). The p16 protein was strongly expressed in normal skin melanocytes. Immunocytochemistry showed that p16 protein was mainly localized in the nuclei of the melanoma cells and normal melanocytes, if it was expressed. Deletions of p16INK4a gene was uncommon and loss of p16 protein expression was common event in melanoma, especially in the later stages of melanoma."
21680547,"A significant proportion of mucosal melanomas contain alterations in KIT. The aim of this study was to characterize the pattern of KIT, NRAS, and BRAF mutations in mucosal melanomas at specific sites and to assess activation of the KIT downstream RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways in mucosal melanoma specimens."
24423917,Uveal melanoma is the most frequent primary tumour of the eye. It is molecularly clearly distinct from cutaneous melanoma and shows a different pattern of driver mutations. The influence of sunlight ultraviolet (UV) exposure on the aetiology of uveal melanoma is a matter of debate. The recent identification of driver mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene with UV-induced cytidine-to-thymidine transitions in cutaneous melanoma prompted us to investigate whether these mutations also occur in uveal melanoma.
23673539,"U1 Adaptor is a recently discovered oligonucleotide-based gene-silencing technology with a unique mechanism of action that targets nuclear pre-mRNA processing. U1 Adaptors have two distinct functional domains, both of which must be present on the same oligonucleotide to exert their gene-silencing function. Here, we present the first in vivo use of U1 Adaptors by targeting two different human genes implicated in melanomagenesis, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1), in a human melanoma cell xenograft mouse model system. Using a newly developed dendrimer delivery system, anti-BCL2 U1 Adaptors were very potent and suppressed tumor growth at doses as low as 34 µg/kg with twice weekly intravenous (iv) administration. Anti-GRM1 U1 Adaptors suppressed tumor xenograft growth with similar potency. Mechanism of action was demonstrated by showing target gene suppression in tumors and by observing that negative control U1 Adaptors with just one functional domain show no tumor suppression activity. The anti-BCL2 and anti-GRM1 treatments were equally effective against cell lines harboring either wild-type or a mutant V600E B-RAF allele, the most common mutation in melanoma. Treatment of normal immune-competent mice (C57BL6) indicated no organ toxicity or immune stimulation. These proof-of-concept studies represent an in-depth (over 800 mice in ~108 treatment groups) validation that U1 Adaptors are a highly potent gene-silencing therapeutic and open the way for their further development to treat other human diseases.Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e92; doi:10.1038/mtna.2013.24; published online 14 May 2013."
19830692,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs ( approximately 22 bp) that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression. MiRNAs possess oncogenic or tumor suppressor activity in various tumors but little is known about miRNA expression pattern in malignant melanoma. We determined the expression level of 16 potentially relevant miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-34a, miR-210, let-7I, miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-27a, miR-27b, miR-100, miR-137, miR-222, miR-373-1, miR-373*) by real-time PCR in 6 preparations of normal melanocytes vs. 10 melanoma cell lines and in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue of 11 melanocytic nevi versus 16 melanomas. MiR-15b and miR-210 were significantly upregulated, miR-34a was significantly downregulated in melanomas compared with melanocytic nevi. These 3 miRNAs were analyzed in a total of 128 primary melanomas from patients with detailed clinical follow-up information. High expression of miR-15b (but not miR-210 upregulation and miR-34a downregulation) was significantly associated with poor recurrence free survival and overall survival by univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox analyses. Downregulation of miR-15b in two melanoma cell lines with high miR-15b expression by transfection with anti-miR-15b siRNA was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation, whereas apoptosis was increased. In summary, miRNA expression levels show distinct differences comparing benign and malignant melanocytic cell proliferations and can provide independent prognostic informations. MiR-15b appears to represent a particular important miRNA in melanoma that is associated with poor prognosis and tumorigenesis."
9824622,"The nm23 gene was originally identified by differential hybridization of metastatic murine melanoma cell lines. Some experimental studies demonstrated a significantly low metastatic potential of melanoma cell lines transfected with the nm23 gene. In this study, we clarified the relationship between intracellular nm23-immunoreactivity and lymph nodal status of human breast cancer. We analyzed 82 surgically removed breast tumors including 67 invasive carcinomas (ductal, lobular and mucinous carcinomas). The nm23 expression was diffusely positive in the benign tumors and non-invasive carcinomas. Of the invasive ductal carcinomas, lymph node metastasis was found in 67.7% (21/31) of the focally positive/negative cases and in 18.2% (4/22) of the diffusely positive cases (p<0.001). Immunohistochemically, advanced margins of invasive carcinomas with lymph node metastasis were shown to be negative for nm23 expression, while intraductal carcinoma components were positive. This observation suggested that focally positive/negative nm23 expression can be a predictor of lymph node metastasis of invasive ductal breast carcinoma."
15705881,"The population frequencies of the CDKN2A variants remain undetermined. In Poland there are three common variants of CDKN2A: an alanine to threonine substitution (A148T), Nt500c>g and Nt540c>t, which have been detected in other populations. To establish if they are associated with an increased malignant melanoma (MM) risk we did an association study based on genotyping 471 patients with MM and 1,210 random control subjects from the same Polish population. We found a significantly increased frequency of the A148T variant among patients with MM (7.0%) in comparison with the general population (2.9%). The incidence of the A148T variant remained greater in both unselected and familial melanoma subgroups. A statistically significant positive association was seen for unselected MM (odds ratio, 2.529; P = 0.0003), especially in patients diagnosed under 50 years of age (odds ratio, 3.4; P = 0.0002). The A148T carrier population (heterozygous G/A alleles) was more likely to have a relative with malignancy compared with the noncarrier population (57% versus 36%, respectively; P = 0.03). Further examination of the CDKN2A promoter sequence done in 20 melanoma patients with the A148T change (heterozygous G/A alleles) and 20 patients with MM without this alteration identified it was in linkage disequilibrium with a polymorphism in the promoter region at position P-493. We found no statistically significant overrepresentation of the Nt500c>g and the Nt540c>t polymorphisms in the Polish melanoma population. In conclusion, the A148T variant of the CDKN2A gene seems to be associated with an increased risk of development of MM. Additional studies are required to confirm whether this particular change is associated with increased risk of other nonmelanoma malignancies."
27337967,"B-RAF gene is a component of the MAPK pathway that plays a very important role in cell division, survival, proliferation, and many other cellular functions. Mutations of the B-RAF (such as V600E-B-RAF) lead to melanoma, which is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. R&amp;D progress is being done aiming at improved therapy in the future. The existing melanoma therapy is left out with poor overall survival, drug resistance, and many side effects. With the recent approval of new drugs, there is a hope for melanoma patients for complete cure and better life quality. However, there is still a need for improved, safe, and complete therapy for advanced melanoma. This review describes melanoma caused by V600E-B-RAF gene mutation, its pathway, drugs available and recently approved drugs, and future prospects to be overcome."
25220161,"A co-delivery system that can transport cancer related microRNAs and chemotherapeutics to their distinct targets in the tumors is an attractive strategy to eliminate tumor relapse in lung cancer therapy. In this study, we developed a dual-drug delivery system for an endogenous microRNA (miR-34a) and paclitaxel (PTX) for synergistic cancer therapy. PTX (a meiotic inhibitor) and miR-34a were loaded into cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (miSLNs-34a/PTX) which were used to treat murine B16F10-CD44(+) melanoma metastasized to the lungs of mice. This nanoparticle system demonstrated good protection for miR-34a and PTX from degradation in the serum, and had an average size of approximately 220 nm by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS). In vitro, the parallel activity of PTX and miR-34a show synergistic anticancer efficacy. In vivo, miSLNs-34a/PTX showed passive targetability to the tumor-bearing lung tissues, and was demonstrated to be much more potent in inhibition of B16F10-bearing tumor growth and elimination of cancer cell populations in the lung than single drug-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles. It has been shown that such co-delivery of miR-34a and PTX is promising for enhanced cancer therapy to reduce tumor relapse."
26424760,KIT has been suggested to be a potential therapeutic target for malignant melanoma. We evaluated the antitumor activity and safety of the KIT inhibitor nilotinib in metastatic melanoma patients harboring KIT gene mutations or amplifications.
21108607,"The purpose of the study was to determine the frequency of expression p53 and p16INK4a proteins and bcl-2 oncoprotein in malignant skin melanoma and to determine their correlation with the proliferative index and tumor thickness. The study involved 53 patients: 27 (51%) male and 26 (49%) female. Mitotic index showed a correlation with p53 protein expression, a negative correlation with p16INK4a protein expression. Statistically significant correlations were determined between the Breslow tumor thickness, Clark invasion level and p53 protein expression, as well as Breslow tumor thickness and bcl-2 oncoprotein expression (p<0.05), whereas there was no correlation between the p16INK4a protein expression and melanoma thicknes and Clark invasion level. Overexpression p53 protein and bcl-2 oncoprotein, with the loss p16INK4a protein of expression in the nodular melanoma, confirms a frequent loss of function of these tumor suppressor gene and oncogene, and indicates a vertical tumor growth phase. The loss of tumor suppression function the p53 protein and bcl-2 oncoprotein overexpression in cutaneous melanoma correlates with larger tumor thickness, whereas the overexpression of mutated p53 protein and loss p16INK4a protein of expression indicate a higher proliferative tumour potential. Therefore, these evaluated proteins may be the aggressive biological tumour activity markers."
22223089,"The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing faster than that for any other cancer. Histological examination of skin excision biopsies remains the standard method for melanoma diagnosis and prognosis. Significant morphological overlap between benign and malignant lesions complicates diagnosis, and tumour thickness is not always an accurate predictor of prognosis."
11668523,"In this report we present the results of mutational analysis of the CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CDK4, p53 genes and 5'UTR of the CDKN2A gene in a set of 44 sporadic primary melanomas, which had been earlier analysed for mutations in the CDKN2A (p16/p14(ARF)) gene. No tumour-associated mutations were detected except in 1 melanoma where we found a CC>T* deletion-mutation in the codon 151-152 (exon 5) of the p53 gene. On the basis of our preliminary results, we did extended genotyping of the 500 C>G and 540 C>T polymorphisms in the 3'UTR of the CDKN2A gene in 229 melanoma cases and 235 controls. The T-allele frequency (for 540 C>T polymorphism) in melanomas was significantly higher than in controls (0.14 vs. 0.08; chi(2) = 5.95, p = 0.01; OR = 1.71, 95%CI = 1.11-2.66). The heterozygote frequency for this polymorphism was 0.26 (59/229) in melanomas compared to 0.13 (30/235) in healthy controls (chi(2) = 11.4; p = 0.0007; OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.40-3.92). The frequency of the 500 C>G polymorphism in the 3'UTR in the CDKN2A gene was not significantly higher in melanomas compared to healthy controls. The 500 C>G polymorphism, however, was in linkage disequilibrium with approximately 50 kb apart the C>A intronic polymorphism in the CDKN2B gene (determined in 44 melanomas and 90 controls; Fisher exact test, p<0.0001). Finally, the sequence analysis of genomic DNA isolated from T cell lymphocytes of healthy individuals exhibited that the codon reported as last of exon 2 of the CDKN2C gene is rather the first codon of exon 3."
10389768,"CDKN2A appears to be the major melanoma susceptibility gene, and is also mutated/deleted in sporadic tumours of various types including melanoma. Thus far most approaches to assessing the functionality of mutations in this gene have used in vitro methods such as CDK4 binding and kinase inhibition assays, with sometimes disparate conclusions about functional significance of some variants between studies. We have used a melanoma cell line (MM96L) with no functional p16, as the basis for a ""semi-in vivo"" transfection-based assay for exogenous p16 functionality based on the growth parameters of the cells and the behaviour of variant proteins after transfection of different CDKN2A cDNAs. Colony counts performed on these transfectants revealed that all but the wild type, + 24 bp ad A148T variants have a diminished ability to inhibit cell growth. All other variants detected either constitutionally in familial melanoma patients (I49T, R87P, G101W and V126D) or somatically in melanomas (N71S, and P81L), appeared functionally impaired in this assay. This diminution of function was independent of CDK4 and CDK6 binding ability. Furthermore, the predominant localization of these variants within the cell was different from that of wt p16. This mislocalization may provide an explanation for their lack of function, or alternatively, it may also be an indicator that the cells are processing unstable, misfolded p16 proteins. This novel assay for assessment of functionality of p16 variants may better reflect the role of some of these mutations in vivo, and as such is a useful adjunct to other in vitro assays."
24120113,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be responsible for drug resistance, metastasis of tumors. To investigate the biological characteristics of CD44+CD133+CSCs with over- expressing microRNA-200c (miR-200c), and to provide evidences for miR-200c as a tumor suppressor to treat melanoma. CD44+CD133+CSCs were isolated from the mouse melanoma B16F10 cell line by using immune magnetic activated cell sorting. The lentivirus miR-200c was transduced into the cells, and the effect of miR-200c overexpression on the biological characteristics of B16F10 CD44+ CD133+CSCs was analyzed by a series assays. The stable overexpression of miR-200c in B16F10 CD44+CD133+CSCs obviously resulted in downregulation of zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 expression, reduction of the cell proliferation, colony forming, cell migratory and invasion ability in vitro as well as tumorigenicity in vivo compared with those of the B16F10 cells and B16F10 non-CD44+ CD133+CSCs. These findings suggest that the miR-200c overexpression as a novel strategy to target therapy of melanoma CSCs."
11813878,"Despite its ambiguous name the protein melanoma-inhibitory-activity (MIA) was identified as a key molecule involved in progression and metastasis of malignant melanomas. Therefore, in this review we intend to update the current knowledge on expression patterns, transcriptional regulation, function and clinical relevance of MIA. Furthermore, we will cover the recently discovered MIA homologous proteins OTOR/MIAL, MIA 2 and TANGO. In order to identify autocrine growth-regulatory factors secreted by melanoma cells, MIA was purified and cloned. Subsequent analyses of non-neoplastic tissues revealed specific MIA expression patterns in cartilage. In neoplastic tissues MIA expression was detected in malignant melanomas, in chondrosarcomas and less frequently in a variety of different adenocarcinomas including breast and colon cancers. For melanoma cells and chondrocytes it was shown that regulation of expression pattern was controlled on the level of mRNA transcription by defined transcription factors. Evidence obtained from in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that MIA plays an important functional role in melanoma metastasis and invasion. A number of studies from different laboratories evaluated MIA as a highly specific and sensitive marker, clinically useful for follow-up and therapy-monitoring of patients with malignant melanomas. In addition, preliminary data suggests a further potential application as a surrogate marker for measuring cartilage damage in rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, it has become evident that MIA belongs to a gene family of four homologous proteins, MIA, OTOR (FDP, MIAL), MIA 2 and TANGO. Determination of the three-dimensional structure in solution identified MIA as the first member of this novel family of secreted, extracellular proteins adopting an SH3 domain-like fold. The data suggest specific protein-protein interactions with components of the extracellular matrix and possibly epitopes on cellular surfaces and will certainly attract further interest and investigations."
19725989,"Based on epidemiological data we can assume that at least some malignant melanoma (MM) and breast cancer cases can be caused by the same genetic factors. CDKN2A, which encodes the p16 protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor suppressing cell proliferation, is regarded as a major melanoma susceptibility gene and the literature has also implicated this gene in predisposition to breast cancer. Genes also known to predispose to MM include XPD and MC1R. We studied CDKN2A/ARF, XPD and MC1R for their associations with melanoma and breast cancer risk in Polish patients and controls. We found that CDKN2A and ARF do not contribute significantly to either familial melanoma or malignant melanoma within the context of a cancer familial aggregation of disease with breast cancer. However, the common variant of the CDKN2A gene A148T, previously regarded as non-pathogenic, may predispose to malignant melanoma, early-onset breast cancer and lung cancer. Compound carriers of common XPD variants may be at slightly increased risk of breast cancer or late-onset malignant melanoma. Common recurrent variants of the MC1R gene (V60L, R151C, R163Q and R160W) may predispose to malignant melanoma. In general, the establishment of surveillance protocols proposed as an option for carriers of common alterations in CDKN2A, XPD or MC1R variants requires additional studies. It is possible that missense variants of genes for which truncating mutations are clearly pathogenic may also be deleterious, but with reduced penetrance. This may be overlooked unless large numbers of patients and controls are studied. A registry that includes 2000 consecutive breast cancer cases, 3500 early onset breast cancer patients, 500 unselected malignant melanoma and over 700 colorectal cancer patients has been established in the International Hereditary Cancer Centre and can contribute to these types of large association studies."
24370793,The immune response has been implicated in the control of uveal melanoma progression. Epigenetic mechanisms mediated by specific microRNAs (miRs) regulate immune responses.
11931386,"Mutations in the mismatch DNA repair gene human MutS homologen 2 (hMSH2) are causative for microsatellite instability and carcinogenesis in various human tumours, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Because microsatellite instability has been detected in malignant melanoma, we have investigated hMSH2 in melanocytic tumours. We found strong nuclear immunoreactivity for hMSH2 that was elevated in malignant melanoma and melanoma metastases as compared to acquired nevi. These findings suggest that increased genomic instability in malignant melanoma is associated with elevated protein levels of this DNA repair enzyme. hMSH2 is not exclusively regulated by proliferative activity in melanocytes, because there was no correlation between staining patterns of hMSH2 and the proliferation marker Ki-67. In contrast, immunoreactivity scores for hMSH2 and p53 were both upregulated in malignant melanocytic tumours. These findings support the concept that hMSH2 gene expression may be regulated in melanocytes by the p53 protein, as has been reported previously in other tissues. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we detected strong hMSH2 mRNA expression in each of 8 melanoma cell lines analysed (highest amounts in SK-MEL-25 cells, lowest amounts in MML-I cells). In conclusion, our findings indicate that hMSH-2 may be of importance for genetic stability, tumorigenesis and progression of malignant melanoma."
25501033,"MicroRNAs are short regulatory RNAs that are able to post-transcriptionally modulate gene expression and that have crucial roles in the control of physiological and pathological processes including cancer onset, growth, and progression. miR-214, located inside the sequence of the long noncoding Dmn3os transcript, contributes to the regulation of normal and cancer cell biology, even if it operates in a context-dependent and sometimes contradictory manner. miR-214 is deregulated in several human tumors including melanoma, breast, ovarian, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinomas. miR-214's pleiotropic and tumor-specific contribution to various cancer formation and progression hallmarks is achieved via its several target genes. In fact, miR-214 behaves as a key hub by coordinating fundamental signaling networks such as PTEN/AKT, β-catenin, and tyrosine kinase receptor pathways. Interestingly, miR-214 also regulates the levels of crucial gene expression modulators: the epigenetic repressor Ezh2, ""genome guardian"" p53, transcription factors TFAP2, and another microRNA, miR-148b. Thus, miR-214 seems to have essential roles in coordinating tumor proliferation, stemness, angiogenesis, invasiveness, extravasation, metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy, and microenvironment. The sum of current literature reports suggests that miR-214 is a molecular hub involved in the control of cancer networks and, as such, could be a potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and target for therapeutic intervention."
23197006,"Sry-related HMg-Box gene 10 (SOX10) is a nuclear transcription factor that plays an important role in melanocytic cell differentiation. It has been shown to be a sensitive marker of melanoma including spindle and desmoplastic subtypes. We assessed its frequency of expression in melanoma, carcinoma, benign nevi, and non-neoplastic tissues with routine immunohistochemistry for SOX10. The 109 primary melanoma included 49 epithelioid, 19 spindle cell, 22 desmoplastic, and 19 mixed spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma. All primary, except 8 desmoplastic melanoma, and 11 metastatic melanoma were strongly and diffusely nuclear SOX10-positive. Six desmoplastic melanoma had ≤10% cells positive, and 2 were <50% positive, all of 3+ intensity. Eighteen of 149 (12%) breast carcinoma were SOX10-positive. All 24 ovarian, 23 endometrial, 26 lung, and 25 colon carcinoma were SOX10-negative. All 43 benign nevi, 18 dysplastic nevi, 68 non-neoplastic and benign skins, and all 56 non-neoplastic breast tissue were SOX10-positive. The sensitivity and specificity for SOX10 in the diagnosis of melanoma are 1.0 and 0.93, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values are 0.87 and 1.0, respectively. SOX10 is a sensitive, specific marker for melanoma. As benign nevi also express SOX10, it cannot be used to differentiate between benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions. Only a small number of breast carcinoma (12%), and breast lobules, express SOX10; no carcinoma of the ovary, endometrium, lung, or colon expressed SOX10."
19805117,"Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of cutaneous carcinoma, accounting for 75% of all deaths caused by skin cancers. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a master gene regulating melanocyte development and functions as a ""lineage addiction"" oncogene in malignant melanoma. We have identified the receptor protein tyrosine kinase TYRO3 as an upstream regulator of MITF expression by a genome-wide gain-of-function cDNA screen and show that TYRO3 induces MITF-M expression in a SOX10-dependent manner in melanoma cells. Expression of TYRO3 is significantly elevated in human primary melanoma tissue samples and melanoma cell lines and correlates with MITF-M mRNA levels. TYRO3 overexpression bypasses BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence in primary melanocytes, inducing transformation of non-tumorigenic cell lines. Furthermore, TYRO3 knockdown represses cellular proliferation and colony formation in melanoma cells, and sensitizes them to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis; TYRO3 knockdown in melanoma cells also inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that TYRO3 may serve as a target for the development of therapeutic agents for melanoma."
23020925,"The paired box homeotic gene 3 (PAX3) is a crucial regulator for the maintenance of melanocytic progenitor cells and has a poorly defined role in melanoma. To understand how PAX3 affects melanocyte and melanoma proliferation, we identified potential PAX3 downstream targets through gene expression profiling. Here, we identify T-box 2 (TBX2), a key developmental regulator of cell identity and an antisenescence factor in melanoma, as a directly regulated PAX3 target. We also found that TBX2 is involved in the survival of melanoma cells and is overexpressed in some melanoma specimens. The identification of TBX2 as a target for PAX3 provides a key insight into how PAX3 may contribute to melanoma evolution and may provide opportunities for prosenescence therapeutic intervention aimed at disrupting the ability of PAX3 to regulate TBX2."
25223485,"Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a cell surface molecule that plays a critical role in suppressing immune responses, mainly through binding of the PD-1 receptor on T lymphocytes. PD-L1 may be expressed by metastatic melanoma (MM). However, its clinical and biological significance remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether expression of PD-L1 in MM identifies a biologically more aggressive form of the disease, carrying prognostic relevance."
18398432,"In most Dutch melanoma families, a founder deletion in the melanoma susceptibility gene CDKN2A (which encodes p16) is present. This founder deletion (p16-Leiden) accounts for a significant proportion of the increased melanoma risk. However, it does not account for the Atypical Nevus (AN) phenotype that segregates in both p16-Leiden carriers and non-carriers. The AN-affected p16-Leiden family members are therefore a unique valuable resource for unraveling the genetic etiology of the AN phenotype, which is considered both a risk factor and a precursor lesion for melanoma. In this study, we performed a genome-wide scan for linkage in four p16-Leiden melanoma pedigrees, classifying family members with five or more AN as affected. The strongest evidence for an atypical nevus susceptibility gene was mapped to chromosome band 7q21.3 (two-point LOD score=2.751), a region containing candidate gene CDK6."
17182868,"It is widely held that cells with metastatic properties such as invasiveness and expression of matrix metalloproteinases arise through the stepwise accumulation of genetic lesions arising from genetic instability and ""clonal evolution."" By contrast, we show here that in melanomas invasiveness can be regulated epigenetically by the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, Mitf, via regulation of the DIAPH1 gene encoding the diaphanous-related formin Dia1 that promotes actin polymerization and coordinates the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule networks at the cell periphery. Low Mitf levels lead to down-regulation of Dia1, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased ROCK-dependent invasiveness, whereas increased Mitf expression leads to decreased invasiveness. Significantly the regulation of Dia1 by Mitf also controls p27(Kip1)-degradation such that reduced Mitf levels lead to a p27(Kip1)-dependent G1 arrest. Thus Mitf, via regulation of Dia1, can both inhibit invasiveness and promote proliferation. The results imply variations in the repertoire of environmental cues that determine Mitf activity will dictate the differentiation, proliferative, and invasive/migratory potential of melanoma cells through a dynamic epigenetic mechanism."
25065585,"Melanoma is frequently lethal and its global incidence is steadily increasing. Despite the rapid development of different modes of targeted treatment, durable clinical responses remain elusive. A complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive melanomagenesis is required, both genetic and epigenetic, in order to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. There is increased appreciation of the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in melanoma biology, including in proliferation, cell cycle, migration, invasion, and immune evasion. Data are also emerging on the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as SPRY4-IT1, BANCR, and HOTAIR, in melanomagenesis. Here we review the data on the miRNAs and lncRNAs implicated in melanoma biology. An overview of these studies will be useful for providing insights into mechanisms of melanoma development and the miRNAs and lncRNAs that might be useful biomarkers or future therapeutic targets."
24174333,"Metastasis is the major cause for high mortality of lung cancer with the underlying mechanisms poorly understood. The scaffolding protein neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9 (NEDD9) has been identified as a pro-metastasis gene in several types of cancers including melanoma and breast cancer. However, the exact role and related mechanism of NEDD9 in regulating lung cancer metastasis still remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NEDD9 knockdown significantly inhibits migration, invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The pro-metastasis role of Nedd9 in lung cancer is further supported by studies in mice models of spontaneous cancer metastasis. Moreover, we find that NEDD9 promotes lung cancer cell migration and invasion through the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) potentially via focal adhesion kinase activation. More importantly, NEDD9 expression inversely correlates with E-cadherin expression in human lung cancer specimens, consistent with the findings from in vitro studies. Taken together, this study highlights that NEDD9 is an important mediator promotes lung cancer metastasis via EMT."
19477635,"Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) is a rare recessive autosomal genodermatosis predisposing to multiple early onset skin cancers, including melanoma. XPV results from mutations of the POLH gene that encodes a DNA translesion polymerase. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that POLH variants could be associated with melanoma risk."
24189220,"Molecular etiology of thyroid cancers has been widely studied, and several molecular alterations have been identified mainly associated with follicular and papillary histotypes. However, the molecular bases of the complex pathogenesis of thyroid carcinomas remain poorly understood. HOX genes regulate normal embryonic development, cell differentiation and other critical processes in eukaryotic cell life. Several studies have shown that HOX genes play a role in neoplastic transformation of several human tissues. In particular, the genes belonging to HOX paralogous group 13 seem to hold a relevant role in both tumor development and progression. We have identified a significant prognostic role of HOX D13 in pancreatic cancer and we have recently showed the strong and progressive over-expression of HOX C13 in melanoma metastases and deregulation of HOX B13 expression in bladder cancers. In this study we have investigated, by immunohistochemisty and quantitative Real Time PCR, the HOX paralogous group 13 genes/proteins expression in thyroid cancer evolution and progression, also evaluating its ability to discriminate between main histotypes. Our results showed an aberrant expression, both at gene and protein level, of all members belonging to paralogous group 13 (HOX A13, HOX B13, HOX C13 and HOX D13) in adenoma, papillary and follicular thyroid cancers samples. The data suggest a potential role of HOX paralogous group 13 genes in pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of thyroid cancers."
19330028,"A mutational analysis of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family in human melanoma identified somatic mutations in 23% of melanomas. Five mutations in one of the most commonly mutated genes, MMP8, reduced MMP enzyme activity. Expression of wild-type but not mutant MMP8 in human melanoma cells inhibited growth on soft agar in vitro and tumor formation in vivo, suggesting that wild-type MMP-8 has the ability to inhibit melanoma progression."
23536873,"Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the fastest increasing malignancy in humans. Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is a novel growth factor identified from human hepatoma cell line. HDGF overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis in various types of cancer including melanoma. However, the underlying mechanism of HDGF overexpression in developing melanoma remains unclear. In this study, human melanoma cell lines (A375, A2058, MEL-RM and MM200) showed higher levels of HDGF gene expression, whereas human epidermal melanocytes (HEMn) expressed less. Exogenous application of HDGF stimulated colony formation and invasion of human melanoma cells. Moreover, HDGF overexpression stimulated the degree of invasion and colony formation of B16-F10 melanoma cells whereas HDGF knockdown exerted opposite effects in vitro. To evaluate the effects of HDGF on tumour growth and metastasis in vivo, syngeneic mouse melanoma and metastatic melanoma models were performed by manipulating the gene expression of HDGF in melanoma cells. It was found that mice injected with HDGF-overexpressing melanoma cells had greater tumour growth and higher metastatic capability. In contrast, mice implanted with HDGF-depleted melanoma cells exhibited reduced tumor burden and lung metastasis. Histological analysis of excised tumors revealed higher degree of cell proliferation and neovascularization in HDGF-overexpressing melanoma. The present study provides evidence that HDGF promotes tumor progression of melanoma and targeting HDGF may constitute a novel strategy for the treatment of melanoma."
7665237,"CD63 has been identified in human melanoma cells by a number of different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Studies with MAbs have shown that expression is most marked in naevi and early forms of cutaneous melanoma and reduced in vertical growth phase and metastatic lesions. To investigate further the role of CD63 in progression of melanoma, genomic CD63 was transfected into a CD63-negative human melanoma cell line using an episomal vector. The stable transfected melanoma cells had similar growth rates to control transfected melanoma cells in vitro but much lower growth rates when injected intradermally into athymic nude mice. The CD63-transfected cells also had a reduced number of metastases in the peritoneal cavity and subcutaneous sites when injected intravenously. MAb against CD63 did not influence the growth of CD63-transfected melanoma cells in vitro. Our results confirm previous studies using H-ras-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts and suggest that CD63 may have a role as a tumor suppressor gene in human melanoma that acts to limit invasion and progression of melanoma."
22076652,"The PTEN gene is one of the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor genes in sporadic cancers. Inactivating mutations and deletions of the PTEN gene are found in many types of cancers, including melanoma. However, the exact frequency of PTEN alteration in melanoma is unknown. In this study, we comprehensively reviewed 16 studies on PTEN genetic changes in melanoma cell lines and tumor biopsies. To date, 76 PTEN alterations have been reported in melanoma cell lines and 38 PTEN alterations in melanoma biopsies. The rate of PTEN alterations in melanoma cell lines, primary melanoma, and metastatic melanoma is 27.6, 7.3, and 15.2%, respectively. Three mutations were found in both melanoma cell lines and biopsies. These mutations are scattered throughout the gene, with the exception of exon 9. A mutational hot spot is found in exon 5, which encodes the phosphatase activity domain. Evidence is also presented to suggest that numerous homozygous deletions and missense variants exist in the PTEN transcript. Studying PTEN functions and implications of its mutations and other genes could provide insights into the precise nature of PTEN function in melanoma and additional targets for new therapeutic approaches."
20848731,"Disseminated melanoma is an aggressive disease with fatal outcome. Better understanding of the underlying biology is needed to find effective treatment. We applied microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, gene expression and CpG island methylation analysis of primary tumors and multiple metastases from five melanoma patients with the aim of analyzing the molecular patterns of melanoma progression. Epigenetic profiling showed that the multiple metastases after a single primary melanoma share similar methylation patterns for many genes, although differences in methylation between the lesions were evident for several genes, example, PTEN, TFAP2C, and RARB. In addition, DNA copy number and global gene expression profiles of tumors from individual patients were highly similar, confirming common origin of metastases. Some of the identified genomic aberrations, for example, gain of chromosome 6p and loss of chromosomes 6q and 10, persisted during progression, indicating early changes highly important for melanoma development. Homozygous deletions at 3p26.1 and 6q23.2-q23.3 appeared in two consecutive metastases originating from the same primary tumor, respectively, in a mutually exclusive manner that provides evidence for two genetically different subclones. However, in another case, the similarity of the copy number aberrations in subsequent metastatic lesions suggests sequential metastatic development through the clonal evolution. These data are further corroborated by a switch in CDH1 and CDH2 expression between metastases from the same patient. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for different models of metastatic progression in melanoma."
25310020,"SRY-box containing gene 17 (Sox17), a transcription factor, is considered as an antagonist to canonical Wnt/β‑catenin signaling in several types of malignant tumors. As the influence of Sox17 in the pathogenesis of human melanoma is still unknown, the investigation of Sox17 expression in melanoma is warranted and its prognostic value is of great interest. In the present study, Sox17 expression was examined in 525 cases of melanocytic lesions (33 common acquired nevi, 59 dysplastic nevi, 291 primary melanomas and 142 metastatic melanomas) at different stages by tissue microarray. The correlation of Sox17 expression with melanoma progression and its prognostic value in melanoma patients were examined. We also analyzed the correlation between Sox17 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 expression in 374 melanoma samples. The results showed that Sox17 expression was significantly decreased in primary and metastatic melanoma compared to common acquired nevi and dysplastic nevi (P=2.4x10-17). Furthermore, Sox17 expression was inversely correlated with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (P=4.6x10-15), thickness (P=0.00004) and ulceration (P=0.03). Notably, reduced Sox17 expression was correlated with a poorer overall and disease-specific 5- and 10-year survival of the patients. Multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that Sox17 is an independent prognostic marker for melanoma patients. Moreover, we found a significant positive correlation between Sox17 and p27 expression in melanoma biopsies; their concomitant expression was closely correlated with the survival of melanoma patients. Taken together, decreased Sox17 expression is correlated with melanoma progression, an unfavorable survival of melanoma patients and is an independent molecular prognostic factor for melanoma."
25885043,"Cutaneous melanoma is the most lethal skin cancer and its incidence in developed countries has dramatically increased over the past decades. Localized tumors are easily treated by surgery, but advanced melanomas lack efficient treatment and are associated with very poor outcomes. Thus, understanding the processes underlying melanoma development and progression is critical. The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) acts as a potent tumor suppressor in human melanoma, by inhibiting cell growth and preventing cellular migration and invasion."
9389568,"The CDKN2A gene encodes p16 (CDKN2A), a cell-cycle inhibitor protein which prevents inappropriate cell cycling and, hence, proliferation. Germ-line mutations in CDKN2A predispose to the familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome but also have been seen in rare families in which only 1 or 2 individuals are affected by cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). We therefore sequenced exons 1alpha and 2 of CDKN2A using lymphocyte DNA isolated from index cases from 67 families with cancers at multiple sites, where the patterns of cancer did not resemble those attributable to known genes such as hMLH1, hMLH2, BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53 or other cancer susceptibility genes. We found one mutation, a mis-sense mutation resulting in a methionine to isoleucine change at codon 53 (M531) of exon 2. The individual tested had developed 2 CMMs but had no dysplastic nevi and lacked a family history of dysplastic nevi or CMM. Other family members had been diagnosed with oral cancer (2 persons), bladder cancer (1 person) and possibly gall-bladder cancer. While this mutation has been reported in Australian and North American melanoma kindreds, we did not observe it in 618 chromosomes from Scottish and Canadian controls. Functional studies revealed that the CDKN2A variant carrying the M531 change was unable to bind effectively to CDK4, showing that this mutation is of pathological significance. Our results have confirmed that CDKN2A mutations are not limited to FAMMM kindreds but also demonstrate that multi-site cancer families without melanoma are very unlikely to contain CDKN2A mutations."

21047771,"The disintegrin-metalloproteinases with thrombospondin domains (ADAMTS) genes have been suggested to function as tumor suppressors as several have been found to be epigenetically silenced in various cancers. We performed a mutational analysis of the ADAMTS gene family in human melanoma and identified a large fraction of melanomas to harbor somatic mutations. To evaluate the functional consequences of the most commonly mutated gene, ADAMTS18, six of its mutations were biologically examined. ADAMTS18 mutations had little effect on melanoma cell growth under standard conditions, but reduced cell dependence on growth factors. ADAMTS18 mutations also reduced adhesion to laminin and increased migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Melanoma cells expressing mutant ADAMTS18 had reduced cell migration after short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of ADAMTS18, suggesting that ADAMTS18 mutations promote growth, migration, and metastasis in melanoma."
19557432,An altered expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) has been found in malignant melanoma cells. We performed an association study to investigate the effect of putative functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of BMP4 on development of cutaneous melanoma (CM).
24014427,"Melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) represents a frequent complication of cutaneous melanoma. Despite aggressive multi-modality therapy, patients with MBM often have a survival rate of <1 year. Alteration in DNA methylation is a major hallmark of tumor progression and metastasis; however, it remains largely unexplored in MBM. In this study, we generated a comprehensive DNA methylation landscape through the use of genome-wide copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data integrative analysis of melanoma progression to MBM. A progressive genome-wide demethylation in low CpG density and an increase in methylation level of CpG islands according to melanoma progression were observed. MBM-specific partially methylated domains (PMDs) affecting key brain developmental processes were identified. Differentially methylated CpG sites between MBM and lymph node metastasis (LNM) from patients with good prognosis were identified. Among the most significantly affected genes were the HOX family members. DNA methylation of HOXD9 gene promoter affected transcript and protein expression and was significantly higher in MBM than that in early stages. A MBM-specific PMD was identified in this region. Low methylation level of this region was associated with active HOXD9 expression, open chromatin and histone modifications associated with active transcription. Demethylating agent induced HOXD9 expression in melanoma cell lines. The clinical relevance of this finding was verified in an independent large cohort of melanomas (n = 145). Patients with HOXD9 hypermethylation in LNM had poorer disease-free and overall survival. This epigenome-wide study identified novel methylated genes with functional and clinical implications for MBM patients."
22447182,"Previous studies have indicated the antitumoral effect of human melanocytes, human melanoma cell lines expressing CB1 receptor (CB1), and of the peritumoral administration of endocannabinoids. In the present study, we systematically screened several human melanoma cell lines for the expression of CNR1 and demonstrated transcription of the authentic gene. The product of CNR1, the CB1 protein, was found localized to the cell membrane as well as to the cytoskeleton. Further, the studied human melanoma cell lines expressed functional CB1 since physiological and synthetic ligands, anandamide (AEA), Met-F-AEA, ACEA and AM251 showed a wide range of biological effects in vitro, for example anti-proliferative, proapoptotic and anti-migratory. More importantly, our studies revealed that systemic administration of a stable CB1 agonist, ACEA, into SCID mice specifically inhibited liver colonization of human melanoma cells. Since therapeutic options for melanoma patients are still very limited, the endocannabinoid-CB1 receptor system may offer a novel target."
21494614,"Wnt signaling is important in development and can also contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. The Secreted Frizzled Related Proteins (SFRPs) constitute a family of Wnt modulators, crucial for controlling Wnt signaling. Here we investigate the expression and role of SFRP3 in melanoma."
25155861,"Identification of primary melanoma patients at the highest risk of recurrence remains a critical challenge, and monitoring for recurrent disease is limited to costly imaging studies. We recently reported our array-based discovery of prognostic serum miRNAs in melanoma. In the current study, we examined the clinical utility of these serum-based miRNAs for prognosis as well as detection of melanoma recurrence."
27181209,"Melanoma progression is associated with increased invasion and, often, decreased levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Accordingly, downregulation of MITF induces invasion in melanoma cells; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here, we report for the first time that depletion of MITF results in elevation of intracellular GTP levels and increased amounts of active (GTP-bound) RAC1, RHO-A and RHO-C. Concomitantly, MITF-depleted cells display larger number of invadopodia and increased invasion. We further demonstrate that the gene for guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMPR) is a direct MITF target, and that the partial repression of GMPR accounts mostly for the above phenotypes in MITF-depleted cells. Reciprocally, transactivation of GMPR is required for MITF-dependent suppression of melanoma cell invasion, tumorigenicity and lung colonization. Moreover, loss of GMPR accompanies downregulation of MITF in vemurafenib-resistant BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-melanoma cells and underlies the increased invasion in these cells. Our data uncover novel mechanisms linking MITF-dependent inhibition of invasion to suppression of guanylate metabolism."
23028833,"The relatively high co-occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and melanoma has been established by a large number of epidemiological studies. However, a clear biological explanation for this finding is still lacking. Ultra-violet radiation (UVR)-induced skin melanin synthesis is a defense mechanism against UVR-induced damage relevant to the initiation of melanoma, whereas, increased neuromelanin (NM), the melanin synthesized in dopaminergic neurons, may enhance the susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury relevant to PD. SNCA is a PD-causing gene coding for alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) that expresses not only in brain, but also in skin as well as in tumors, such as melanoma. The findings that α-Syn can interact with tyrosinase (TYR) and inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), both of which are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of melanin and dopamine (DA), led us to propose that α-Syn may participate in the regulation of melanin synthesis. In this study, by applying ultraviolet B (UVB) light, a physiologically relevant stimulus of melanogenesis, we detected melanin synthesis in A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells and in SH-SY5Y and PC12 dopaminergic neuronal cells and determined effects of α-Syn on melanin synthesis. Our results showed that UVB light exposure increased melanin synthesis in all 4 cell lines. However, we found that α-Syn expression reduced UVB light-induced increase of melanin synthesis and that melanin content was lower when melanoma cells were expressed with α-Syn, indicating that α-Syn may have inhibitory effects on melanin synthesis in melanoma cells. Different from melanoma cells, the melanin content was higher in α-Syn-over-expressed dopaminergic neuronal SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells, cellular models of PD, than that in non-α-Syn-expressed control cells. We concluded that α-Syn could be one of the points responsible for the positive association between PD and melanoma via its differential roles in melanin synthesis in melanoma cells and in dopaminergic neuronal cells."

19718013,"The role of immunohistochemistry in the assessment of KIT status in melanomas, especially acral lentiginous/mucosal, is not well established. Although the reported prevalence of KIT mutations in acral lentiginous/mucosal melanomas is relatively low, detection of mutations in KIT can have profound therapeutic implications. We evaluated the efficacy of immunohistochemistry to predict mutations in KIT. One hundred seventy-three tumors, comprising primary and metastatic melanomas (141 acral lentiginous/mucosal, 5 nodular, 4 lentigo maligna, 3 superficial spreading, 2 uveal, 1 melanoma of soft parts, 8 metastases from unclassified primaries, and 9 metastases from unknown primaries) were studied. Immunohistochemical expression of KIT using an anti-CD117 antibody and KIT mutational analysis by gene sequencing of exons 11, 13, and 17 were performed. Eighty-one percent of acral lentiginous/mucosal melanomas, primary and metastatic, showed KIT expression by at least 5% of the tumor cells. The overall frequency of activating KIT gene mutations in acral lentiginous/mucosal melanomas was 15% (14 out of 91 cases), being the L576P mutation in exon 11 the most frequently detected (4 of 14 cases). Cases showing less than 10% positive tumor cells were negative for KIT mutations. Eighty-two percent (12 of 14) of cases positive for KIT mutation showed KIT expression in more than 50% of the cells. An association between immunohistochemical expression of KIT and mutation status was found (P=0.007). Immunohistochemical expression of KIT in less than 10% of the cells of the invasive component of acral lentiginous/mucosal melanomas appears to be a strong negative predictor of KIT mutation and therefore can potentially be used to triage cases for additional KIT genotyping."
15466193,"Malignant melanoma is the skin cancer with the most significant impact on man, carrying the highest risk of death from metastasis. Both incidence and mortality rates continue to rise each year, with no effective long-term treatment on the horizon. In part, this reflects lack of identification of critical genes involved and specific therapies targeted to correct these defects. We report that selective activation of the Akt3 protein promotes cell survival and tumor development in 43 to 60% of nonfamilial melanomas. The predominant Akt isoform active in melanomas was identified by showing that small interfering RNA (siRNA) against only Akt3, and not Akt1 or Akt2, lowered the amount of phosphorylated (active) Akt in melanoma cells. The amount of active Akt3 increased progressively during melanoma tumor progression with highest levels present in advanced-stage metastatic melanomas. Mechanisms of Akt3 deregulation occurred through a combination of overexpression of Akt3 accompanying copy number increases of the gene and decreased PTEN protein function occurring through loss or haploinsufficiency of the PTEN gene. Targeted reduction of Akt3 activity with siRNA or by expressing active PTEN protein stimulated apoptotic signaling, which reduced cell survival by increasing apoptosis rates thereby inhibiting melanoma tumor development. Identifying Akt3 as a selective target in melanoma cells provides new therapeutic opportunities for patients in the advanced stages of this disease."
23977234,"Truncating germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA-1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) have been reported in families predisposed to developing a wide range of different cancer types including uveal melanoma and cutaneous melanoma. There has also been an association between amelanotic tumor development and germline BAP1 mutation suggesting a possible phenotypic characteristic of BAP1 mutation carriers. Though there have been many types of cancer associated with germline BAP1 mutation, the full spectrum of disease association is yet to be ascertained. Here we describe a Danish family with predominantly uveal melanoma but also a range of other tumor types including lung, neuroendocrine, stomach, and breast cancer; as well as pigmented skin lesions. Whole-exome sequencing identified a BAP1 splice mutation located at c.581-2A>G, which leads to a premature truncation of BAP1 in an individual with uveal melanoma. This mutation was carried by several other family members with melanoma or various cancers. The finding expands on the growing profile of BAP1 as an important uveal and cutaneous melanoma tumor suppressor gene and implicates its involvement in the development of lung, and stomach cancer."

25444926,"We performed a comparative study between two human metastatic melanoma cell lines (A375 and 526), and melanocytes (FOM78) by gene expression profiling and pathway analysis, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Genes involved in Ran signaling were significantly over-represented (p ≤ 0.001) and up-regulated in melanoma cells. A melanoma-associated molecular pathway was identified, where Ran, Aurora Kinase A (AurkA) and TERT were up-regulated, while c-myc and PTEN were down-regulated. A consistent high Ran and AurkA gene expression was detected in about 48% and 53%, respectively, of 113 tissue samples from metastatic melanoma patients. AurkA down-regulation was observed in melanoma cells, by Ran knockdown, suggesting AurkA protein is a Ran downstream target. Furthermore, AurkA inhibition, by exposure of melanoma cells to MLN8054, a specific AurKA inhibitor, induced apoptosis in both melanoma cell lines and molecular alterations in the IPA-identified molecular pathway. These alterations differed between cell lines, with an up-regulation of c-myc protein level observed in 526 cells and a slight reduction seen in A375 cells. Moreover, Ran silencing did not affect the A375 invasive capability, while it was enhanced in 526 cells, suggesting that Ran knockdown, by AurkA down-regulation, resulted in a Ran-independent enhanced melanoma cell invasion. Finally, AurK A inhibition induced a PTEN up-regulation and its action was independent of B-RAF mutational status. These findings provide insights relevant for the development of novel therapeutic strategies as well as for a better understanding of mechanisms underlying therapy resistance in melanoma."
18386818,"We previously showed that mice carrying an activated Cdk4 mutation together with melanocyte-specific mutant Hras (Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras) develop melanoma spontaneously, but penetrance is increased and age of onset reduced after neonatal ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. UVR-treated mice were more likely to develop multiple primary lesions, and these melanomas more often expressed Trp53, and less often expressed c-Myc, than melanomas from nonirradiated mice (Hacker et al., Cancer Res 2006;66:2946-52). These data suggest differences in mechanisms of tumorigenesis between melanomas developing spontaneously, or as a result of UVR exposure. To further delineate these differences, we compared global gene expression between spontaneous and UVR-induced melanomas from these mice using microarrays. We found 264 genes differentially expressed between these groups (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Selected candidate genes were validated using qRT-PCR, which confirmed upregulation of Gpr155 and Bmp7, and downregulation of Plagl1, Akap12 and Il18 in UVR-induced mouse melanomas. In humans, epidemiological studies suggest that there may be 2 predominant pathways to melanoma development. One characterized by chronic UVR exposure and which leads mainly to melanomas on sun-exposed sites; the other associated with low UVR exposure and leading predominantly to melanomas on less-exposed body sites. We found by immunohistochemical analysis that, comparing a series of human melanomas from the head (a chronically sun-exposed site; N = 82) with a set from the trunk (an intermittently exposed site; N = 65), the prevalence of IL-18 expression was significantly lower in melanomas on the head (16%) than on truncal melanomas (34%, p = 0.011). We conclude that loss of IL-18 is a marker of UVR-induced melanoma, both in animal models and humans."
26707830,"Several anti-tumour properties have been ascribed to the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3) gene, including inhibition of neovascularisation in tumour xenografts. Reduced protein expression has been linked to promoter hypermethylation and allelic loss of heterozygosity in various human malignancies. In melanoma-positive lymph nodes from patients, we evaluated the association between TIMP3 expression, vessel density, macrophage infiltration and potential correlations with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)."
16961930,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common hereditary neurocutaneous disorder and it is associated with an elevated risk for malignant tumors of tissues derived from neural crest cells. The NF1 gene is considered a tumor suppressor gene and inactivation of both copies can be found in NF1-associated benign and malignant tumors. Melanocytes also derive from neural crest cells but melanoma incidence is not markedly elevated in NF1. In this study we could analyze a typical superficial spreading melanoma of a 15-year-old boy with NF1 for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within the NF1 gene. Neurofibromatosis in this patient was transmitted by the boy's farther who carried the mutation NF1 c. 5546 G/A.
23950209,"Metastatic melanoma remains a mostly incurable disease. Although newly approved targeted therapies are efficacious in a subset of patients, resistance and relapse rapidly ensue. Alternative therapeutic strategies to manipulate epigenetic regulators and disrupt the transcriptional program that maintains tumor cell identity are emerging. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenome readers known to exert key roles at the interface between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that BRD4, a BET family member, is significantly upregulated in primary and metastatic melanoma tissues compared with melanocytes and nevi. Treatment with BET inhibitors impaired melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth and metastatic behavior in vivo, effects that were mostly recapitulated by individual silencing of BRD4. RNA sequencing of BET inhibitor-treated cells followed by Gene Ontology analysis showed a striking impact on transcriptional programs controlling cell growth, proliferation, cell-cycle regulation, and differentiation. In particular, we found that, rapidly after BET displacement, key cell-cycle genes (SKP2, ERK1, and c-MYC) were downregulated concomitantly with the accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (p21 and p27), followed by cell-cycle arrest. Importantly, BET inhibitor efficacy was not influenced by BRAF or NRAS mutational status, opening the possibility of using these small-molecule compounds to treat patients for whom no effective targeted therapy exists. Collectively, our study reveals a critical role for BRD4 in melanoma tumor maintenance and renders it a legitimate and novel target for epigenetic therapy directed against the core transcriptional program of melanoma."
11245423,"The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in connective tissue destruction during cancer invasion and metastasis. A naturally occurring variant arising from the insertion or deletion of a guanine in the promoter of the MMP-1 gene has recently been reported and shown to influence its transcriptional activity in melanoma cells. In this study, MMP-1 genotype was determined in 139 Caucasian patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma. The insertion allele was associated with deep invasive, and therefore poorer-prognosis, primary tumors [(34% of patients with vertical growth phase tumor were homozygous for the insertion allele compared with 17% of patients with horizontal growth phase tumor (P = 0.0333; odds ratio = 2.51)]. These data suggest that the invasiveness of cutaneous malignant melanoma is influenced by variation in the MMP-1 gene promoter that affects MMP-1 expression."
22454080,Novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies are urgently required for malignant melanoma. Ecto-5-prime-nucleotidase (NT5E; CD73) overexpression has been reported in several human cancers. The mechanism(s) underlying deregulated expression and the clinical consequences of changes in expression are not known.
23277422,"KISS-1 is a metastasis-suppressor gene of human melanoma, and encodes metastin, which was identified as the ligand of a G-protein-coupled receptor (metastin receptor). The precursor protein is cleaved to 54 amino acids, which may be further truncated into carboxy-terminal fragments. Previous studies showed that lack of metastin receptor in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is associated with tumor progression, but the prediction of metastasis in patients with pT1 clear cell RCC after radical nephrectomy is difficult. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of metastin receptor immunohistochemistry in predicting metastasis after nephrectomy for pT1 clear cell RCC. After verification of the correlation between immunostaining and mRNA expression, we evaluated the clinical value of metastin receptor immunohistochemistry. Fifty-four patients were enrolled in this study; following radical nephrectomy, seven patients were found to have lung metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value with negative immunostaining of metastin receptor were 85.7, 97.6, 46.2, and 97.6 %, respectively. Metastasis-free survival rates were significantly higher in patients with positive staining (97.6 %) than in patients with negative staining (53.8 %) (P < 0.001). In univariate analysis for metastasis-free survival, negative immunostaining of metastin receptor was a significant risk factor for metastasis (P = 0.001). Furthermore, negative immunostaining of metastin receptor was an independent predictor for metastasis in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 3.735; 95 % CI 0.629-22.174; P = 0.002). In conclusion, our study suggests that negative expression of metastin receptor in clear cell RCC is significantly related to metastasis."
24691438,"In multiple forms of cancer, constitutive activation of type I IFN signaling is a critical consequence of immune surveillance against cancer; however, PBMCs isolated from cancer patients exhibit depressed STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN-α, suggesting IFN signaling dysfunction. Here, we demonstrated in a coculture system that melanoma cells differentially impairs the IFN-α response in PBMCs and that the inhibitory potential of a particular melanoma cell correlates with NOS1 expression. Comparison of gene transcription and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) between melanoma cells from different patients indicated that suppression of IFN-α signaling correlates with an amplification of the NOS1 locus within segment 12q22-24. Evaluation of NOS1 levels in melanomas and IFN responsiveness of purified PBMCs from patients indicated a negative correlation between NOS1 expression in melanomas and the responsiveness of PBMCs to IFN-α. Furthermore, in an explorative study, NOS1 expression in melanoma metastases was negatively associated with patient response to adoptive T cell therapy. This study provides a link between cancer cell phenotype and IFN signal dysfunction in circulating immune cells."
24158781,"Genetic predisposition plays a major role in the etiology of melanoma, but known genetic markers only account for a limited fraction of family-history-associated melanoma cases. Expression microarrays have offered the opportunity to identify further genomic profiles correlated with family history of melanoma. We aimed to distinguish mRNA expression signatures between melanoma cases with and without a family history of melanoma."
23638386,"Genome-wide microarray technology has facilitated the systematic discovery of diagnostic biomarkers of cancers and other pathologies. However, meta-analyses of published arrays often uncover significant inconsistencies that hinder advances in clinical practice. Here we present an integrated microarray analysis framework, based on a genome-wide relative significance (GWRS) and genome-wide global significance (GWGS) model. When applied to five microarray datasets on melanoma published between 2000 and 2011, this method revealed a new signature of 200 genes. When these were linked to so-called 'melanoma driver' genes involved in MAPK, Ca(2+), and WNT signaling pathways we were able to produce a new 12-gene diagnostic biomarker signature for melanoma (i.e., EGFR, FGFR2, FGFR3, IL8, PTPRF, TNC, CXCL13, COL11A1, CHP2, SHC4, PPP2R2C, and WNT4). We have begun to experimentally validate a subset of these genes involved in MAPK signaling at the protein level, including CXCL13, COL11A1, PTPRF and SHC4 and found these to be over-expressed in metastatic and primary melanoma cells in vitro and in situ compared to melanocytes cultured from healthy skin epidermis and normal healthy human skin. While SHC4 has been reported previously to be associated to melanoma, this is the first time CXCL13, COL11A1, and PTPRF have been associated with melanoma on experimental validation. Our computational evaluation indicates that this 12-gene biomarker signature achieves excellent diagnostic power in distinguishing metastatic melanoma from normal skin and benign nevus. Further experimental validation of the role of these 12 genes in a new signaling network may provide new insights into the underlying biological mechanisms driving the progression of melanoma."
21454583,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by repressing translation or directing sequence-specific degradation of complementary mRNA. Here, we report that expression of miR-205 is significantly suppressed in melanoma specimens when compared with nevi and is correlated inversely with melanoma progression. miRNA target databases predicted E2F1 and E2F5 as putative targets. The expression levels of E2F1 and E2F5 were correlated inversely with that of miR-205 in melanoma cell lines. miR-205 significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of reporter plasmids containing the 3'-UTR sequences complementary to either E2F1 or E2F5. Overexpression of miR-205 in melanoma cells reduced E2F1 and E2F5 protein levels. The proliferative capacity of melanoma cells was suppressed by miR-205 and mediated by E2F-regulated AKT phosphorylation. miR-205 overexpression resulted in induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by increased cleaved caspase-3, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and cytochrome c release. Stable overexpression of miR-205 suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor cell growth in vivo and induced a senescence phenotype accompanied by elevated expression of p16INK4A and other markers for senescence. E2F1 overexpression in miR-205-expressing cells partially reversed the effects on melanoma cell growth and senescence. These results demonstrate a novel role for miR-205 as a tumor suppressor in melanoma."
22909381,"Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-5 is a transcription factor involved in type I interferon signaling whose germ line variants have been associated with autoimmune pathogenesis. Since relationships have been observed between development of autoimmunity and responsiveness of melanoma to several types of immunotherapy, we tested whether polymorphisms of IRF5 are associated with responsiveness of melanoma to adoptive therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)."
25848976,"Recent investigation has identified association of IL-12p40 blood levels with melanoma recurrence and patient survival. No studies have investigated associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with melanoma patient IL-12p40 blood levels or their potential contributions to melanoma susceptibility or patient outcome. In the current study, 818,237 SNPs were available for 1,804 melanoma cases and 1,026 controls. IL-12p40 blood levels were assessed among 573 cases (discovery), 249 cases (case validation), and 299 controls (control validation). SNPs were evaluated for association with log[IL-12p40] levels in the discovery data set and replicated in two validation data sets, and significant SNPs were assessed for association with melanoma susceptibility and patient outcomes. The most significant SNP associated with log[IL-12p40] was in the IL-12B gene region (rs6897260, combined P=9.26 × 10(-38)); this single variant explained 13.1% of variability in log[IL-12p40]. The most significant SNP in EBF1 was rs6895454 (combined P=2.24 × 10(-9)). A marker in IL12B was associated with melanoma susceptibility (rs3213119, multivariate P=0.0499; OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.00-2.24), whereas a marker in EBF1 was associated with melanoma-specific survival in advanced-stage patients (rs10515789, multivariate P=0.02; HR=1.93, 95% CI 1.11-3.35). Both EBF1 and IL12B strongly regulate IL-12p40 blood levels, and IL-12p40 polymorphisms may contribute to melanoma susceptibility and influence patient outcome."
19627587,"Matrix Metalloproteinase functions in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix that is integral for many normal and pathological processes such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and tumor invasion. The tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase family including the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) regulates the activity of multifunctional metalloproteinase. It is known that IL-8, the target gene of NF-kappaB pathway, increases in the melanoma cells. However, it is not clear whether the TIMP-2 expression regulates the NF-kappaB pathway. In this study, we have used stable melanoma cell lines, parental A2058, A2058T2-1 overexpressing TIMP-2, and A2058T2R-7 underexpressing TIMP-2, to determine the TIMP-2 regulation of the NF-kappaB activity."
21119596,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ∼22nt single stranded RNAs that negatively regulate protein expression by binding to partially complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTRs) of target gene messenger RNAs (mRNA). Recently, mutations have been identified in both miRNAs and target genes that disrupt regulatory relationships, contribute to oncogenesis and serve as biomarkers for cancer risk. KIT, an established oncogene with a multifaceted role in melanogenesis and melanoma pathogenesis, has recently been shown to be upregulated in some melanomas, and is also a target of the miRNA miR-221. Here, we describe a genetic variant in the 3' UTR of the KIT oncogene that correlates with a greater than fourfold increased risk of acral melanoma. This KIT variant results in a mismatch in the seed region of a miR-221 complementary site and reporter data suggests that this mismatch can result in increased expression of the KIT oncogene. Consistent with the hypothesis that this is a functional variant, KIT mRNA and protein levels are both increased in the majority of samples harboring the KIT variant. This work identifies a novel genetic marker for increased heritable risk of melanoma."
22130252,"Dysregulation of microRNA-21 plays critical roles in tumor initiation and progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the status of microRNA-21 expression in human cutaneous malignant melanoma and determine its clinical significance. TaqMan(®) real-time RT-PCR assay was performed to examine the expression of microRNA-21 in 10 cases of dysplastic nevi, 86 cases of primary cutaneous melanomas, 10 cases of melanoma metastases. The correlation of microRNA-21 expression with clinicopathological factors or prognosis of patients with cutaneous melanoma was statistically analyzed. Additionally, the effects of microRNA-21 expression on growth, apoptosis and chemo- or radiosensitivity of melanoma cells were also investigated by transfection of microRNA-21 inhibitor. We firstly showed that increased levels of microRNA-21 expression were shown from dysplastic nevi to primary cutaneous melanomas to melanoma metastases. Moreover, high miR-21 expression was found to be correlated with Breslow thickness and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high microRNA-21 expression showed shorter 5-year disease-free or overall survival than those with low microRNA-21 expression. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis showed that the status of microRNA-21 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of patients. Antisense-mediated microRNA-21 inhibition could significantly suppress growth, increase apoptosis and enhance chemo- or radiosensitivity of human cutaneous melanoma cells by inducing the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Thus, the status of microRNA-21 might be an independent prognostic factor for patients with cutaneous melanoma, and microRNA-21 has the potential of being a novel molecular target for the treatment of human cutaneous melanoma."
21558391,"The identification of cancer-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and the investigation of their molecular and biological functions are important to understand the molecular biology of cancer and its progression. Although the functions of lncRNAs and the mechanisms regulating their expression are largely unknown, recent studies are beginning to unravel their importance in human health and disease. Here, we report that a number of lncRNAs are differentially expressed in melanoma cell lines in comparison to melanocytes and keratinocyte controls. One of these lncRNAs, SPRY4-IT1 (GenBank accession ID AK024556), is derived from an intron of the SPRY4 gene and is predicted to contain several long hairpins in its secondary structure. RNA-FISH analysis showed that SPRY4-IT1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of melanoma cells, and SPRY4-IT1 RNAi knockdown results in defects in cell growth, differentiation, and higher rates of apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. Differential expression of both SPRY4 and SPRY4-IT1 was also detected in vivo, in 30 distinct patient samples, classified as primary in situ, regional metastatic, distant metastatic, and nodal metastatic melanoma. The elevated expression of SPRY4-IT1 in melanoma cells compared to melanocytes, its accumulation in cell cytoplasm, and effects on cell dynamics, including increased rate of wound closure on SPRY4-IT1 overexpression, suggest that the higher expression of SPRY4-IT1 may have an important role in the molecular etiology of human melanoma."
22496449,"The melanocyte-specific transcription factor M-MITF is involved in numerous aspects of melanoblast lineage biology including pigmentation, survival, and migration. It plays complex roles at all stages of melanoma progression and metastasis. We established previously that GLI2, a Kruppel-like transcription factor that acts downstream of Hedgehog signaling, is a direct transcriptional target of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway and contributes to melanoma progression, exerting antagonistic activities against M-MITF to control melanoma cell invasiveness. Herein, we dissected the molecular mechanisms underlying both TGF-β and GLI2-driven M-MITF gene repression. Using transient cell transfection experiments with M-MITF promoter constructs, chromatin immunoprecipitation, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified a GLI2 binding site within the -334/-296 region of the M-MITF promoter, critical for GLI2-driven transcriptional repression. This region is, however, not needed for inhibition of M-MITF promoter activity by TGF-β. We determined that TGF-β rapidly repressed protein kinase A activity, thus reducing both phospho-cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) levels and CREB-dependent transcription of the M-MITF promoter. Increased GLI2 binding to its cognate cis-element, associated with reduced CREB-dependent transcription, allowed maximal inhibition of the M-MITF promoter via two distinct mechanisms."
22971344,"Melanomas resist conventional chemotherapeutics, in part, through intrinsic disrespect of apoptotic checkpoint activation. In this study, using an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen, we identified RhoJ and its effector PAK1, as key modulators of melanoma cell sensitivity to DNA damage. We find that RhoJ activates PAK1 in response to drug-induced DNA damage, which then uncouples ATR from its downstream effectors, ultimately resulting in a blunted DNA damage response (DDR). In addition, ATR suppression leads to the decreased phosphorylation of ATF2 and consequent increased expression of the melanocyte survival gene Sox10 resulting in a higher DDR threshold required to engage melanoma cell death. In the setting of normal melanocyte behavior, this regulatory relationship may facilitate appropriate epidermal melanization in response to UV-induced DNA damage. However, pathologic pathway activation during oncogenic transformation produces a tumor that is intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy and has the propensity to accumulate additional mutations. These findings identify DNA damage agents and pharmacologic inhibitors of RhoJ/PAK1 as novel synergistic agents that can be used to treat melanomas that are resistant to conventional chemotherapies."
22846175,"Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) was identified in 1997 as a tumor suppressor gene through mapping of homozygous mutations occurring in multiple sporadic tumor types and in patients with cancer predisposition syndromes including Cowden disease (Song et al., 2012). Since that time, PTEN has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated or deleted genes in human cancers, including human skin cancers. In particular, loss of PTEN function through mutation or deletion has been observed in up to 70% of melanoma cell lines, and epigenetic silencing of PTEN has been observed in 30-40% of malignant melanomas (Mehnert and Kluger, 2012)."

8102131,"The nm23 gene is a potential metastasis-suppressor gene originally identified in a murine melanoma line. Several investigators have reported the probable inverse association of nm23 expression with disease prognosis and/or metastasis. Since there are now 2 known isotypes of human nm23, namely nm23-HI and -H2, we immunohistochemically examined expression of these isotypes in human breast-cancer tissues using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for each isotype protein. We also analyzed expression of c-erbB-2 in the same collection of cancer tissues, in order to examine the significance of nm23 expression in comparison with c-erbB-2 expression. Of 130 tumors from breast-cancer patients, 73 (56%) and 69 (53%) positively expressed nm23-HI and -H2 respectively. Expression of c-erbB-2 was positive in 36 (28%). Expression of nm23-HI, but not nm23-H2, was inversely associated with lymph-node metastasis (p < 0.01). Expression of c-erbB-2 was associated with Tnm stage, tumor size and lymph-node metastasis (p < 0.01, p < 0.05 and p < 0.05 respectively). Overall survival was better (p = 0.014) in patients in whom expression of nm23-HI was positive than in those in whom it was negative. In multivariate analyses using a Cox's proportional-hazards regression model with 9 variables, nm23-HI showed the fourth greatest contribution to patient survival following lymph-node metastasis, Tnm stage and menopausal status. No significant contribution was shown for c-erbB-2 expression. nm23-HI, but not nm23-H2, may perform a role in disease prognosis in addition to its participation in cancer metastasis. It may have value for predicting long-term survival of human breast-cancer patients."
25550585,Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a highly abundant housekeeping gene. GAPDH overexpression has been reported in diverse types of human cancers including cutaneous melanoma. Our goal was to quantify GAPDH mRNA and protein expression in the whole spectrum of primary and metastatic melanomas in the search for a specific role for this ubiquitous molecule during tumor progression.
22972589,The high prevalence of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and neuroblastoma v-ras oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutations in melanoma provides a strong rationale to test the clinical efficacy of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition in this disease. The authors hypothesized that the presence of BRAF or NRAS mutations would correlate with clinical benefit among patients who received treatment with combination regimens that included the MEK inhibitor selumetinib.
24405508,"The proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) plays a central role in melanoma progression and its expression level is believed to correlate with the degree of cancer invasiveness. Here, we show that PAR-1 is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-20b microRNA in human melanoma cells. PAR-1 was found to be expressed in metastatic melanoma cells but was barely detectable in primary melanoma. By transducing primary melanoma cells with a lentivirus containing a 3'-UTR construct of PAR-1 mRNA, we could show that endogenous melanoma microRNAs interacted with PAR-1 3'-UTR and silenced a fused luciferase reporter. Transfection of an inhibitor against miR-20b into primary melanoma cells reversed this process. Finally, transfection of miR-20b mimic into metastatic melanoma cells caused downregulation of the luciferase reporter. We conclude that miR-20b regulates expression of melanoma PAR-1 receptor, which may explain the differential expression of PAR-1 observed in human melanoma."
22555176,"Distinct ABCB5 forms and ABCF2, members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, are normally expressed in various tissues and cells, and enhanced expression of both has been demonstrated in select cancers. In melanoma cell lines, gene expression profiling of ABC transporters has revealed enhanced expression of melanocyte-specific ABCB5 and ABCF2 proteins. Given this, our primary aim was to ascertain immunohistochemical expression of the ABC transporters ABCB5 and ABCF2 and, the stem cell marker, nestin in a spectrum of benign and malignant nevomelanocytic proliferations, including nevi (n=30), in situ (n=31) and invasive (n=24) primary cutaneous melanomas to assess their role in the stepwise development of malignancy. In addition, their expression was compared with established melanoma prognosticators to ascertain their utility as independent prognosticators. A semiquantitative scoring system was utilized by deriving a cumulative score (based on percentage positivity cells and intensity of expression) and statistical analyses was carried out using analysis of variance with linear contrasts. Mean cumulative score in nevi, in situ and invasive melanoma were as follows: 3.8, 4.4 and 5.3 for ABCB5, respectively (P<0.005 for all), and 4.6, 4.6 and 5.3 for nestin, respectively (P=not significant for all). No appreciable expression of ABCF2 was noted in any of the groups. While ulcerated lesions of melanoma demonstrated lower levels of expression of ABCB5 and nestin than non-ulcerated lesions, and nestin expression was lower in lesions with mitoses >1, after controlling for the presence of ulceration and mitotic activity, the expression of both proteins did not significantly correlate with known melanoma prognosticators. The gradual increase in the expression of ABCB5 from benign nevus to in situ to invasive melanoma suggests that it plays a role in melanomagenesis. On the basis of our findings, a prospective study with follow-up data is required to ascertain the utility of ABCB5 as a therapeutic target."

25479927,"BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1) is a tumor suppressor gene whose mutations have recently been reported to increase susceptibility for the development of uveal melanoma, cutaneous atypical and epithelioid melanocytic lesions, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and other tumors. Screening for BAP1 mutation/loss/inactivation and BRAFV600E mutation can be done by immunohistochemistry. We investigated BAP1 and BRAFV600E expression in 193 sporadic melanocytic lesions (11 dermal nevi, 20 congenital nevi, 40 primary and nondesmoplastic melanomas, 40 desmoplastic melanomas, 23 metastatic melanomas, 17 Spitz nevi, 19 atypical Spitz nevi, 8 atypical Spitz tumors, 14 proliferative nodules arising in congenital nevi, 1 nevus during pregnancy) and 30 melanocytic lesions from 3 patients with family history of uveal melanoma and BAP1 germline mutation. Most sporadic melanocytic lesions exhibited positive BAP1 nuclear staining, except for 1 proliferative nodule arising in congenital nevus, 1 desmoplastic, 1 nevoid, and 2 metastatic melanomas. BRAFV600E positivity was demonstrated in 80% of dermal, 5% of congenital, 6% of Spitz, and 5.5% of atypical Spitz nevi; 29% of proliferative nodules arising in congenital nevi; and 24% of primary and nondesmoplastic and 35% of metastatic melanomas. Combined BAP1 loss and BRAFV600E staining was seen in 67% of BAP1 tumor syndrome-associated lesions and in none of the sporadic melanocytic proliferations including Spitz and atypical Spitz nevi and atypical Spitz tumors, with the exception of 1 primary melanoma. The combined BAP1-BRAFV600E+ immunoprofile appears to be a constant feature of BAP1 tumor syndrome-associated melanocytic lesions, and the designation of Spitz nevi or variants thereof appears to be inaccurate for this group of lesions."
11744991,"The nm23 gene was originally identified by differential hybridization of metastatic murine melanoma cell lines. Some experimental studies demonstrated a significantly reduced metastatic potential of melanoma cell lines transfected with the nm23 gene. In this study, we clarified the relationship between lymph node status and nm23 immunoreactivity, as well as Ki-67 labeling index (LI), of human breast cancer. Of the 44 breast invasive ductal carcinomas, nm23-diffusely positive expression [nm23(+)] was detected in 17 (38.6%), and focally positive/negative expression [nm23(+/-/-)] in 27 (61.4%) cases. Lymph node metastasis was found at a significantly higher incidence in the nm23(+/-/-) cases (18/27, 66.7%) than in the nm23(+) cases (4/17, 23.5%) (p>0.001). In the lymph node metastasis-positive cases, mean LI of Ki-67 cells was 20.9% at the center of the tumors and 24.0% at the advanced margins. In the lymph node metastasis-negative cases, mean LI of Ki-67 cells was 12.4% at the center of the tumors and 27.2% at the advanced margins. Decrease of nm23 expression, but not Ki-67 LI, was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis of breast invasive ductal carcinoma."
11606406,"We investigated the role of alterations of HDM2, the human homologue of murine mdm2, in the tumorigenesis and progression of cutaneous melanoma. A well-characterized cohort of 172 cases representing different points in the spectrum of melanocyte transformation (16 dysplastic nevi, 11 melanomas in situ, 107 invasive primaries, and 38 metastatic lesions), as well as 11 human melanoma cell lines were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting for HDM2 protein expression, and by either Southern blotting (SB) or fluorescence in situ hybridization for HDM2 gene amplification. HDM2 overexpression, defined as >20% tumor cells showing nuclear immunoreactivity, was observed in 1 of 16 (6%) dysplastic nevi, 3 of 11 (27%) melanomas in situ, and 81 of 145 (56%) invasive primary and metastatic melanomas. Comparable frequencies of HDM2 overexpression were observed among invasive primary cases with differing tumor thicknesses as well as among the metastatic cases: 21 of 40 (53%) at < or =1.5 mm; 31 of 50 (62%) at 1.6-3.9 mm; 10 of 17 (58%) at >4 mm; and 19 of 38 (50%) metastases. HDM2 amplification was observed in 1 of 88 (1%) primary cases using fluorescence in situ hybridization, and in 0 of 12 (0%) metastatic cases that overexpressed HDM2 using SB. Melanoma cell lines expressed HDM2 protein, but there was no evidence of amplification by SB. Our data suggest that HDM2 protein overexpression is common in invasive and metastatic melanoma. Observing HDM2 overexpression in noninvasive melanoma suggests that expression of this oncogene may play an early role in melanocyte transformation. HDM2 amplification occurs infrequently, and other mechanisms that up-regulate HDM2 expression are under investigation."
19035443,"Recent studies showed KIT gene aberrations in a substantial number of melanomas on acral skin and mucosa, suggesting the therapeutic benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. We therefore examined the expression and mutations of KIT in 4 primary and 24 metastatic acral and mucosal melanomas. Immunohistochemistry revealed moderate or strong KIT protein expression in 13 (48%) tumors. Sequence analysis revealed K642E and D820Y mutations in two metastases. Amplification of KIT was identified by real-time PCR in 4 tumors, including one that had K642E. Western blot analysis showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor in 8 (62%) of 13 cryopreserved samples, indicating the frequent pathological activation of the receptor in vivo. Phosphorylation of KIT protein was detected in 2 tumors harboring KIT mutations, as well as in one tumor with KIT gene amplification. Furthermore, 5 tumors without detectable KIT gene aberrations showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in melanoma cells as well as stromal cells suggests SCF/KIT autocrine and paracrine activation in these tumors. Finally, we found significant growth suppressive effects of sunitinib in two acral melanoma cell lines; one harboring the D820Y mutation and one showing SCF-dependent KIT activation. These results show pathological activation of KIT in a substantial number of metastatic tumors of acral and mucosal melanomas, and suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of sunitinib for these melanomas."
15856016,"Germline mutations of CDKN2A that affect the p16INK4a transcript have been identified in numerous melanoma pedigrees worldwide. In the UK, over 50% of pedigrees with three or more cases of melanoma have been found to carry mutations of CDKN2A. Mutations that affect p14ARF exon 1beta exclusively are very rare. This has led to the suggestion that it is p16INK4a and not p14ARF that plays the critical role in melanoma predisposition. We report the identification of a cluster of five different germline mutations at the p14ARF exon 1beta splice donor site in melanoma pedigrees. All the five splice site variants showed evidence of being causal mutations. Three of the variants were demonstrated to result in aberrant splicing of the p14ARF mRNA, confirming their role in melanoma predisposition. No other point mutations were identified in the coding region of p14ARF. The p14ARF transcript of CDKN2A is clearly important in disease predisposition in a subset of melanoma pedigrees. Curiously, the only mutations so far reported to affect p14ARF exon 1beta exclusively have been knockout mutations. Further investigation into the spectrum of mutations observed in this gene may help clarify the exact role of p14ARF in melanoma predisposition."
15920168,"Dynamic instability of microtubules is critical for mitotic spindle assembly and disassembly during cell division, especially in rapidly dividing tumor cells. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are a family of proteins that influence this property. We showed previously that MAP2, a neuron-specific protein that stabilizes microtubules in the dendrites of postmitotic neurons, is induced in primary cutaneous melanoma but is absent in metastatic melanomas. We proposed that induction of a microtubule-stabilizing protein in primary melanoma could disrupt the dynamic instability of microtubules, inhibit cell division and prevent or delay tumor progression. Here we show, by Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate Cox regression analysis, that patients diagnosed with MAP2+ primary melanomas have significantly better metastatic disease-free survival than those with MAP2- disease. Investigation of the mechanisms that underlie the effect of MAP2 on melanoma progression showed that MAP2 expression in metastatic melanoma cell lines leads to microtubule stabilization, cell cycle arrest in G2-M phase and growth inhibition. Disruption of microtubule dynamics by MAP2 resulted in multipolar mitotic spindles, defects in cytokinesis and accumulation of cells with large nuclei, similar to those seen in vivo in MAP2+ primary melanomas cells. These data suggest that ectopic activation of a neuronal differentiation gene in melanoma during early tumor progression inhibits cell division and correlates with inhibition or delay of metastasis."
25435429,"Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), the major regulator of stress response, is frequently activated in cancer and has an apparent role in malignant transformation. Here we analyzed the influence of the over-expression of a constitutively active transcriptionally-competent HSF1 mutant form on phenotypes of mouse and human melanoma cells. We observed that the expression of active HSF1 supported anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and metastatic spread in the animal model in vivo, although the proliferation rate of cancer cells was not affected. Furthermore, active HSF1 enhanced cell motility, reduced the adherence of cells to a fibronectin-coated surface, and affected the actin cytoskeleton. We found that although the expression of active HSF1 did not affect levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, it caused transcriptional down-regulation of vinculin, protein involved in cell motility, and adherence. Functional HSF1-binding sites were found in mouse and human Vcl/VCL genes, indicating a direct role of HSF1 in the regulation of this gene. An apparent association between HSF1-induced down-regulation of vinculin, increased motility, and a reduced adherence of cells suggests a possible mechanism of HSF1-mediated enhancement of the metastatic potential of cancer cells."
23647022,Cutaneous melanoma tumour is classified into clinicohistopathological subtypes that may be associated with different genetic and host factors. Variation in the MC1R gene is one of the main factors of risk variation in sporadic melanoma. The relationship between MC1R variants and the risk of developing a specific subtype of melanoma has not been previously explored.
23825798,"Approximately 10% of melanoma cases are familial, but only 25-40% of familial melanoma cases can be attributed to germ-line mutations in the CDKN2A - the most significant high-risk melanoma susceptibility locus identified to date. The pathogenic mutation(s) in most of the remaining familial melanoma pedigrees have not yet been identified. The most common mutations in nevi and sporadic melanoma are found in BRAF and NRAS, both of which result in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. However, these mutations are not found in uveal melanomas or the intradermal melanocytic proliferations known as blue nevi. Rather, multiple studies report a strong association between these lesions and somatic mutations in Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit alpha (GNAQ), Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit alpha-11 (GNA11), and BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1). Recently, germ-line mutations in BAP1, the gene encoding a tumor suppressing deubiquitinating enzyme, have been associated with predisposition to a variety of cancers including uveal melanoma, but no studies have examined the association of germ-line mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 with uveal melanoma and blue nevi. We have now done so by sequencing exon 5 of both of these genes in 13 unique familial melanoma pedigrees, members of which have had either uveal or cutaneous melanoma and/or blue nevi. Germ-line DNA from a total of 22 individuals was used for sequencing; however no deleterious mutations were detected. Nevertheless, such candidate gene studies and the discovery of novel germ-line mutations associated with an increased MM susceptibility can lead to a better understanding of the pathways involved in melanocyte transformation, formulation of risk assessment, and the development of specific drug therapies."
21559390,"As the incidence of Malignant Melanoma (MM) reflects an interaction between skin colour and UV exposure, variations in genes implicated in pigmentation and tanning response to UV may be associated with susceptibility to MM. In this study, 363 SNPs in 65 gene regions belonging to the pigmentation pathway have been successfully genotyped using a SNP array. Five hundred and ninety MM cases and 507 controls were analyzed in a discovery phase I. Ten candidate SNPs based on a p-value threshold of 0.01 were identified. Two of them, rs35414 (SLC45A2) and rs2069398 (SILV/CKD2), were statistically significant after conservative Bonferroni correction. The best six SNPs were further tested in an independent Spanish series (624 MM cases and 789 controls). A novel SNP located on the SLC45A2 gene (rs35414) was found to be significantly associated with melanoma in both phase I and phase II (P<0.0001). None of the other five SNPs were replicated in this second phase of the study. However, three SNPs in TYR, SILV/CDK2 and ADAMTS20 genes (rs17793678, rs2069398 and rs1510521 respectively) had an overall p-value<0.05 when considering the whole DNA collection (1214 MM cases and 1296 controls). Both the SLC45A2 and the SILV/CDK2 variants behave as protective alleles, while the TYR and ADAMTS20 variants seem to function as risk alleles. Cumulative effects were detected when these four variants were considered together. Furthermore, individuals carrying two or more mutations in MC1R, a well-known low penetrance melanoma-predisposing gene, had a decreased MM risk if concurrently bearing the SLC45A2 protective variant. To our knowledge, this is the largest study on Spanish sporadic MM cases to date."
23477830,"Activating mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma. Inhibition of BRAF by small molecules leads to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We show here that BRAF inhibition also induces an oxidative phosphorylation gene program, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the increased expression of the mitochondrial master regulator, PGC1α. We further show that a target of BRAF, the melanocyte lineage factor MITF, directly regulates the expression of PGC1α. Melanomas with activation of the BRAF/MAPK pathway have suppressed levels of MITF and PGC1α and decreased oxidative metabolism. Conversely, treatment of BRAF-mutated melanomas with BRAF inhibitors renders them addicted to oxidative phosphorylation. Our data thus identify an adaptive metabolic program that limits the efficacy of BRAF inhibitors."
19233913,The detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis correlates with a poor prognosis. The assessment of CTCs from blood has been difficult because of lack of a good monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against surface cell antigens to capture melanoma cells.
19880519,"MAP2 is a neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein that binds and stabilizes dendritic microtubules. Previously, we showed that MAP2 expression is (a) activated in cutaneous primary melanoma and (b) inversely associated with melanoma tumor progression. We also showed that ectopic expression of MAP2 in metastatic melanoma cells inhibits cell growth by inducing mitotic spindle defects and apoptosis. However, molecular mechanisms of regulation of MAP2 gene expression in melanoma are not understood. Here, we show that in melanoma cells MAP2 expression is induced by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-cytidine, and MAP2 promoter is progressively methylated during melanoma progression, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in silencing of MAP2 in melanoma. In support of this, methylation of MAP2 promoter DNA in vitro inhibits its activity. Because MAP2 promoter activity levels in melanoma cell lines also correlated with activating mutation in BRAF, a gene that is highly expressed in neurons, we hypothesized that BRAF signaling is involved in MAP2 expression. We show that hyperactivation of BRAF-MEK signaling activates MAP2 expression in melanoma cells by two independent mechanisms, promoter demethylation or down-regulation of neuronal transcription repressor HES1. Our data suggest that BRAF oncogene levels can regulate melanoma neuronal differentiation and tumor progression."
18444963,"Tbx3, a member of the conserved family of T-box developmental transcription factors, is a transcriptional repressor required during cardiogenesis for the formation and specification of the sinoatrial node, the pacemaker of the heart. Both the TBX3 and the highly related TBX2 genes are also associated with several cancers, most likely as a consequence of their powerful anti-senescence properties mediated via suppression p14(Arf) and p21(CIP) expression. In melanoma, the TBX2 gene is frequently amplified and inhibition of Tbx2 function leads to senescence and up-regulation of p21(CIP), a Tbx2 target gene. Tbx3 + 2a is a splice variant containing an extra 20 amino acids encoded by exon 2a inserted into the highly conserved T-box DNA-binding domain. We find here that Tbx3 + 2a is evolutionary conserved and that similar insertions are largely absent from the T-box domains of other T-box factors. Tbx3 + 2a has been reported to lack DNA-binding ability and act as a functional antagonist of Tbx3. By contrast, we now demonstrate that both Tbx3 and Tbx3 + 2a bind the consensus T-element, the p21(CIP1) promoter, and the Nppa cardiac target gene. Both isoforms also function as repressors of p21(CIP1) and Nppa promoter activity and interact with homeobox factor Nkx2-5. When ectopically expressed in the embryonic heart of mice, Tbx3 and Tbx3 + 2a both suppressed chamber formation and repressed expression of cardiac chamber markers Nppa and Cx40. The results suggest that in the assays used, Tbx3 and Tbx3 + 2a are functionally equivalent and that like Tbx2, Tbx3 may also function as an anti-senescence factor in melanoma."
12473109,"The alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alphaMSH) receptor (MC1R) is a major determinant of mammalian skin and hair pigmentation. Binding of alphaMSH to MC1R in human melanocytes stimulates cell proliferation and synthesis of photoprotective eumelanin pigments. Certain MC1R alleles have been associated with increased risk of melanoma. This can be theoretically considered on two grounds. First, gain-of-function mutations may stimulate proliferation, thus promoting dysplastic lesions. Second, and opposite, loss-of-function mutations may decrease eumelanin contents, and impair protection against the carcinogenic effects of UV light, thus predisposing to skin cancers. To test these possibilities, we sequenced the MC1R gene from seven human melanoma cell (HMC) lines and three giant congenital nevus cell (GCNC) cultures. Four HMC lines and two GCNC cultures contained MC1R allelic variants. These were the known loss-of-function Arg142His and Arg151Cys alleles and a new variant, Leu93Arg. Moreover, impaired response to a superpotent alphaMSH analog was demonstrated for the cell line carrying the Leu93Arg allele and for a HMC line homozygous for wild-type MC1R. Functional analysis in heterologous cells stably or transiently expressing this variant demonstrated that Leu93Arg is a loss-of-function mutation abolishing agonist binding. These results, together with site-directed mutagenesis of the vicinal Glu94, demonstrate that the MC1R second transmembrane fragment is critical for agonist binding and maintenance of a resting conformation, whereas the second intracellular loop is essential for coupling to the cAMP system. Therefore, loss-of-function, but not activating MC1R mutations are common in HMC. Their study provides important clues to understand MC1R structure-function relationships."
23787126,"The basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) protein MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) is a master regulator of melanocyte development. Mutations in the MITF have been found in patients with the dominantly inherited hypopigmentation and deafness syndromes Waardenburg syndrome type 2A (WS2A) and Tietz syndrome (TS). Additionally, both somatic and germline mutations have been found in MITF in melanoma patients. Here, we characterize the DNA-binding and transcription activation properties of 24 MITF mutations found in WS2A, TS and melanoma patients. We show that most of the WS2A and TS mutations fail to bind DNA and activate expression from melanocyte-specific promoters. Some of the mutations, especially R203K and S298P, exhibit normal activity and may represent neutral variants. Mutations found in melanomas showed normal DNA-binding and minor variations in transcription activation properties; some showed increased potential to form colonies. Our results provide molecular insights into how mutations in a single gene can lead to such different phenotypes."
15305193,"Malignant melanoma is a life-threatening skin cancer due to its highly metastatic character and resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. It is believed that the ability to evade apoptosis is the key mechanism for the rapid growth of cancer cells. However, the exact mechanism for failure in the apoptotic pathway in melanoma cells is unclear. p53, the most frequently mutated tumour suppressor gene in human cancers, is a key apoptosis inducer. However, p53 mutation is only found in 15-20% of melanoma biopsies. Recently, it was found that Apaf-1, a downstream target of p53, is inactivated in metastatic melanoma. Specifically, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the Apaf-1 gene was found in 40% of metastatic melanoma. To determine if loss of Apaf-1 expression is indeed involved in melanoma progression, we employed the tissue microarray technology and examined Apaf-1 expression in 70 human primary malignant melanoma biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that Apaf-1 expression is significantly reduced in melanoma cells compared with normal nevi (chi(2)=6.02, P=0.014). Our results also revealed that loss of Apaf-1 was not associated with the tumour thickness, ulceration or subtype, patient's gender, age and 5-year survival. In addition, our in vitro apoptosis assay revealed that overexpression of Apaf-1 can sensitise melanoma cells to anticancer drug treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that Apaf-1 expression is significantly reduced in human melanoma and that Apaf-1 may serve as a therapeutic target in melanoma."
17314512,"Malignant melanoma is still poorly understood at the genomic level. Recently, a new technique for the high-resolution analysis of copy number changes named digital karyotyping was introduced. This approach is derived from SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) and allows the detection of genomic amplifications and deletions, which are indicative of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Four human melanoma cell lines were subjected to analysis by digital karyotyping. 828,780 genomic tags were generated and analyzed quantitatively. Thereby, we identified a somatic, homozygous deletion of 570 kbp removing exons 3-29 of the dystrophin (DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy) gene. Analysis of 51 melanoma cell lines further revealed a homozygous and a hemizygous deletion in DMD. Furthermore, DMD mRNA expression was downregulated with respect to primary melanocytes and accompanied by loss of dystrophin protein expression in 38 of 55 (69%) and significantly reduced in 10 of 55 (18%) melanoma cell lines. Sequence analysis of DMD cDNAs in 37 melanoma cell lines revealed six new sequence variants with a significantly lower frequency than previously described DMD polymorphisms, which may affect dystrophin function. Knock-down of DMD enhanced migration and invasion, whereas re-expression of DMD attenuated migration and induced a senescent phenotype in melanoma cell lines. Therefore, loss of DMD may critically change the migratory and proliferative capacity of melanocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that inactivation of DMD is involved in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma."
17992115,"The Wilms' tumor protein 1 (WT1) is essential for tumor cell proliferation and is highly expressed in various hematological and solid malignancies including human malignant melanoma. We investigated whether WT1 expression is essential for growth in the B16F10 murine melanoma cell line. Toward this end, we examined WT1 protein expression and WT1 isoforms (17AA+/17AA-, KTS+/KTS-) in this cell line. WT1 was silenced by two RNA interference constructs, designated WT1-1 and WT1-2. RNA interference-mediated reduction of WT1 protein expression significantly inhibited B16F10 cell viability. Loss of WT1 also increased caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase activation, as well as apoptotic body formation, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. Together, these findings implicate decreased WT1 protein levels in the induction of apoptosis. These results imply that WT1 plays a distinct role in B16F10 melanoma growth."
22322885,"FABP7 has been implicated in tumour cell proliferation, cell migration, and poor prognosis in patients with high-grade astrocytoma and melanoma. In this study, we examine FABP7 expression in a cohort of 176 primary breast cancers by gene profiling and tissue microarray immunostaining. We show that FABP7 is significantly up-regulated in triple-negative breast cancer. Elevated FABP7 levels are associated with poor prognosis, absence of oestrogen and progesterone hormone receptors (ER, PR) and HER2, increased cell proliferation, and high tumour grade. Depletion of FABP7 in the ER/PR-negative cell line, MDA-MB-435S, significantly reduced cell growth rate and sensitized the cells to growth inhibition by omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A target of DHA-bound FABP7 in the nucleus is RXRβ, a retinoid-activated nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor by either homodimerizing or heterodimerizing with other nuclear receptors such as PPARs. Based on our microarray data, RXRβ, like FABP7, is an adverse prognostic factor for breast cancer. We propose that the DHA-FABP7-RXRβ pathway promotes cell survival/proliferation in triple-negative breast cancer. Targeting this pathway may thus provide an alternate route for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer."
11706558,"A 64-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) developed a primary malignant melanoma of the anus. Genetic analysis of the resected tumor confirmed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the NF1 gene. Anorectal malignant melanoma in NF1 is extremely rare, and genetic studies of the NF1 gene in such patients have not been reported. The allelic loss detected in the present patient supports the previously raised idea that NF1 can function as a tumor suppressor gene in the development of malignant melanoma in patients with NF1."
14576666,"Although various studies have shown mutations of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN/MMAC1, in primary, metastatic, and cultured cutaneous melanoma specimens, little is known about the pattern of PTEN protein expression in early melanocytic tumor progression."
18417445,"The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is steadily increasing. Although several molecular abnormalities have been associated with melanoma progression, the mechanisms underlying the differential gene expression are still largely unknown and targeted therapies are not yet available. Noncoding small RNAs, termed microRNAs (miR), have been recently reported to play important roles in major cellular processes, including those involved in cancer development and progression. We have identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor as a repressor of miR-221 and miR-222 by direct binding to their putative regulatory region. Specifically, PLZF silencing in melanomas unblocks miR-221 and miR-222, which in turn controls the progression of the neoplasia through down-modulation of p27Kip1/CDKN1B and c-KIT receptor, leading to enhanced proliferation and differentiation blockade of the melanoma cells, respectively. In vitro and in vivo functional studies, including the use of antisense ""antagomir"" oligonucleotides, confirmed the key role of miR-221/-222 in regulating the progression of human melanoma; this suggests that targeted therapies suppressing miR-221/-222 may prove beneficial in advanced melanoma."
22927992,"Malignant melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with poor prognosis. Despite improvements in awareness and prevention of this disease, its incidence is rapidly increasing. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that regulate cellular processes by repressing messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with partially complementary target sites. Several miRNAs have already been shown to attenuate cancer phenotypes, by limiting proliferation, invasiveness, tumor angiogenesis, and stemness. Here, we employed a genome-scale lentiviral human miRNA expression library to systematically survey which miRNAs are able to decrease A375 melanoma cell viability. We highlight the strongest inhibitors of melanoma cell proliferation, including the miR-15/16, miR-141/200a and miR-96/182 families of miRNAs and miR-203. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs resulted in long-term inhibition of melanoma cell expansion, both in vitro and in vivo. We show specifically miR-16, miR-497, miR-96 and miR-182 are efficient effectors when introduced as synthetic miRNAs in several melanoma cell lines. Our study provides a comprehensive interrogation of miRNAs that interfere with melanoma cell proliferation and viability, and offers a selection of miRNAs that are especially promising candidates for application in melanoma therapy."
23454771,"The BRAF mutant, BRAF(V600E), is expressed in nearly half of melanomas, and oral BRAF inhibitors induce substantial tumor regression in patients with BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma. The inhibitors are believed to work primarily by inhibiting BRAF(V600E)-induced oncogenic MAPK signaling; however, some patients treated with BRAF inhibitors exhibit increased tumor immune infiltration, suggesting that a combination of BRAF inhibitors and immunotherapy may be beneficial. We used two relatively resistant variants of Braf(V600E)-driven mouse melanoma (SM1 and SM1WT1) and melanoma-prone mice to determine the role of host immunity in type I BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 antitumor activity. We found that PLX4720 treatment downregulated tumor Ccl2 gene expression and decreased tumor CCL2 expression in both Braf(V600E) mouse melanoma transplants and in de novo melanomas in a manner that was coincident with reduced tumor growth. While PLX4720 did not directly increase tumor immunogenicity, analysis of SM1 tumor-infiltrating leukocytes in PLX4720-treated mice demonstrated a robust increase in CD8(+) T/FoxP3(+)CD4(+) T cell ratio and NK cells. Combination therapy with PLX4720 and anti-CCL2 or agonistic anti-CD137 antibodies demonstrated significant antitumor activity in mouse transplant and de novo tumorigenesis models. These data elucidate a role for host CCR2 in the mechanism of action of type I BRAF inhibitors and support the therapeutic potential of combining BRAF inhibitors with immunotherapy."
20602913,"High melanocytic nevus count is a strong predictor of melanoma risk. A GWAS of nevus count in Australian adolescent twins identified an association of nevus count with the interferon regulatory factor 4 gene (IRF4 [p = 6 x 10(-9)]). There was a strong genotype-by-age interaction, which was replicated in independent UK samples of adolescents and adults. The rs12203592(*)T allele was associated with high nevus counts and high freckling scores in adolescents, but with low nevus counts and high freckling scores in adults. The rs12203592(*)T increased counts of flat (compound and junctional) nevi in Australian adolescent twins, but decreased counts of raised (intradermal) nevi. In combined analysis of melanoma case-control data from Australia, the UK, and Sweden, the rs12203592(*)C allele was associated with melanoma (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, p = 4 x 10(-3)), most significantly on the trunk (OR = 1.33, p = 2.5 x 10(-5)). The melanoma association was corroborated in a GWAS performed by the GenoMEL consortium for an adjacent SNP, rs872071 (rs872071(*)T: OR 1.14, p = 0.0035; excluding Australian, the UK, and Swedish samples typed at rs12203592: OR 1.08, p = 0.08)."
25961751,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group endogenous small non-coding RNAs that inhibit protein translation through binding to specific target mRNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are implicated in the development of cancer. However, the role of miR-144 in uveal melanoma metastasis remains largely unknown. MiR-144 was downregulated in both uveal melanoma cells and tissues. Transfection of miR-144 mimic into uveal melanoma cells led to a decrease in cell growth and invasion. After identification of two putative miR-144 binding sites within the 3' UTR of the human c-Met mRNA, miR-144 was proved to inhibit the luciferase activity inMUM-2B cells with a luciferase reporter construct containing the binding sites. In addition, the expression of c-Met protein was inhibited by miR-144. Furthermore, c-Met-mediated cell proliferation and invasion were inhibited by restoration of miR-144 in uveal melanoma cells. In conclusion, miR-144 acts as a tumor suppressor in uveal melanoma, through inhibiting cell proliferation and migration. miR-144 might serve as a potential therapeutic target in uveal melanoma patients."
23377970,"Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumour with increasing -incidence and poor prognosis in the metastatic stage. In recent years, a substantial number of reports on individual miRNAs or miRNA patterns have been published providing strong evidence that miRNAs might play an important role in malignant melanoma and might help to better understand the molecular mechanisms of melanoma development and progression. A major preliminary finding was that melanoma-associated miRNAs are often located in genomic regions with frequent gains and losses in tumours. Detailed studies of different groups thereafter identified miRNAs with differential expression in benign melanocytes compared with melanoma cell lines or in benign melanocytic lesions compared with melanomas. Among these were let-7a and b, miR-23a and b, miR-148, miR-155, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-211, miR214, and miR-221 and 222. Some of these miRNAs target well-known melanoma-associated genes like the NRAS oncogene, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT or AP-2 transcription factors (TFAP2). Although we are still far from a complete understanding of the role of miRNA-target gene interactions in malignant melanoma, these findings further underscore the notion of a direct involvement of miRNAs in melanoma biology. Very recently, a prognostic signature of six miRNAs has been identified consisting of miRNAs miR-150, miR-342-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-145, miR-155, and miR-497. High expression of these miRNAs was shown to be associated with improved long-term survival of metastatic patients."
11112417,"Loss of expression of a novel suppressor of metastasis, melastatin (MLSN1), has recently been reported to correlate with metastatic potential of melanoma cells. Using differential display analysis, we identified MLSN1 among genes overexpressed in pigmented metastatic human melanoma cells treated with the differentiation inducer hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In this study, we show that multiple short transcripts of MLSN1 are present in melanocytes and pigmented metastatic melanoma cell lines while the full-length 5. 4-kb mRNA is detectable only in melanocytes. Treatment of pigmented melanoma cells with the differentiation-inducing agent, HMBA, results in up-regulation of the 5.4-kb MLSN1 mRNA as well as short RNAs. Analysis of a panel of nonpigmented primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines showed weak expression of a 1.8-kb mRNA in a few melanoma cell lines. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses with DNA probes and oligonucleotide primers that correspond to distinct regions of full-length MLSN1 mRNA indicated that the short transcripts contained sequences corresponding primarily to either 5'- or 3'-end of the 5.4-kb mRNA. HMBA appears to up-regulate MLSN1 transcripts derived mainly from the 5'-end. Modulators of cAMP and protein kinase C pathways had no significant effect on MLSN1 expression. Our data show that multiple MLSN1 transcripts, both constitutively expressed and inducible, are present in cultured pigmented melanoma cells, and suggest that MLSN1 expression can be regulated at the level of both transcription and mRNA processing."
24981740,"Although common cancer hallmarks are well established, lineage-restricted oncogenes remain less understood. Here, we report an inherent dependency of melanoma cells on the small GTPase RAB7, identified within a lysosomal gene cluster that distinguishes this malignancy from over 35 tumor types. Analyses in human cells, clinical specimens, and mouse models demonstrated that RAB7 is an early-induced melanoma driver whose levels can be tuned to favor tumor invasion, ultimately defining metastatic risk. Importantly, RAB7 levels and function were independent of MITF, the best-characterized melanocyte lineage-specific transcription factor. Instead, we describe the neuroectodermal master modulator SOX10 and the oncogene MYC as RAB7 regulators. These results reveal a unique wiring of the lysosomal pathway that melanomas exploit to foster tumor progression."
9195562,"Uveal melanoma is characterized by an unpredictable clinical course, during which metastatic disease may occur after a prolonged and, at present, undefinable disease-free interval. Because of its relative rarity and the dispersion of cases, the possible genetic alterations implicated in the invasive and metastatic behaviour of this ocular neoplasm have not yet been characterized. The aim of this immunohistochemical retrospective study was to assess the expression of nm23 gene product, proposed to be a metastasis-suppressor gene, in uveal melanoma and to analyse its prognostic significance in relation to the various conventional histopathological parameters, currently considered the major prognostic indicators in this intra-ocular neoplasm. We analysed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples excised from 33 patients with uveal melanoma. Of these, 22 (67%) were positive for monoclonal antibody nm23. This nm23 positivity was inversely associated with scleral invasion level (P = 0.001) and largest tumour diameter (P = 0.02), which represent the two most significant prognostic factors for metastasis. On the other hand, there was no correlation between nm23 expression and other prognostic markers such as cell type, intraocular location or clinical characteristics. These results may suggest a close relationship between nm23 gene expression and metastatic potential of uveal melanomas. In addition, analysis of nm23 gene expression on bioptic tissue may represent an extreme useful prognostic tool for metastatic progression of uveal melanomas."
20421967,"Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer, arising in cutaneous melanocytes. The transcription factor PAX3 regulates melanocyte specification from neural crest cells during development but expression in differentiated melanocytes is uncertain. By contrast it is frequently found in melanomas and naevi and is a marker for melanoma staging and detection. In this study we analysed the expression of PAX3 across the spectrum of melanocytic cells, from normal melanocytes to cells of benign and malignant lesions to better assess its function in these various tissues. Pax3 and PAX3 (italicized) refer to the mouse and human gene, respectively; whereas Pax3 and PAX3 (non-italicized) refer to the corresponding mouse and human protein."
19149898,"CDKN2A/p16INK4a is frequently altered in human cancers and it is the most important melanoma susceptibility gene identified to date. p16INK4a inhibits pRb phosphorylation and induces cell cycle arrest, which is considered its main tumour suppressor function. Nevertheless, additional activities may contribute to the tumour suppressor role of p16INK4a and could help explain its specific association with melanoma predisposition. To identify such functions we conducted a yeast-two-hybrid screen for novel p16INK4a binding partners."
21356389,"Melanoma is the most deadly tumor of the skin, and systemic therapies for the advanced stage are still limited. Recent genetic analyses have revealed the molecular diversity of melanoma and potential therapeutic targets. By screening a cohort of 142 primary nonepithelial tumors, we discovered that about 10% of melanoma cases (4/39) harbored an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. These mutations were found to coexist with BRAF or KIT mutation, and all IDH1 mutations were detected in metastatic lesions. BRAF-mutated melanoma cells, additionally expressing the cancer-related IDH1 mutant, acquired increased colony-forming and in vivo growth activities and showed enhanced activation of the MAPK and STAT3 pathways. Genome-wide gene expression profiling demonstrated that mutant IDH1 affected the expression of a set of genes. Especially, it caused the induction of growth-related transcriptional regulators (Jun, N-myc, Atf3) and the reduction of Rassf1 and two dehydrogenase genes (Dhrs1 and Adh5), which may be involved in the carcinogenesis of IDH1-mutated tumors. Our analyses demonstrate that IDH1 mutation works with other oncogenic mutations and could contribute to the metastasis in melanoma."
21623876,"Expression of Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is reduced in a large number of cancers. However, a few studies have reported higher expression of RUNX3 in several cancers, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In light of this, we explored the expression of RUNX3 in skin cancers generally, to determine whether it acts as an oncogene or a tumour-suppressor gene in skin tumours."
25048347,"NME1 is a well-documented metastasis suppressor gene, with suppressor activity demonstrated across a wide spectrum of human cancers including melanoma and carcinomas of the breast, stomach and thyroid. A primary aim of the current study was to identify profiles of genes whose expression is regulated by NME1 in cell lines of melanoma and thyroid carcinoma origin. Impact of NME1 was determined by forcing its expression transiently in cell lines using a novel Ad5-based adenoviral vector (Ad5-NME1), followed 48 h later by analysis of RNA expression profiles using the U133A microarray chip. Robust NME1 expression was achieved following infection with the Ad5-NME1 adenovirus in the human metastasis-derived cell lines WM1158 (melanoma) and WRO82 (follicular thyroid carcinoma), resulting in wide-ranging effects on gene expression in both settings. A substantial proportion of the NME1-regulated genes identified in the analyses were of clear potential relevance to metastasis, such as matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), SERPINB9 and colony stimulating factor receptor-2B (CSFR2B). Nine genes were identified (false discovery rate <0.1) that were regulated by NME1 in both the WM1158 and WRO82 cell lines, each possessing one or more such metastasis-relevant activities as stress fiber formation and focal adhesion (PPM1E, ZYX, PFN1), chemotaxis (CCR1) epithelial-mesenchymal signaling (WNT6), differentiation and morphogenesis (TBX4, ZFP36L2), and G protein modulation (GPR52 and PFN1). In addition, a number of the NME1-regulated genes were shown to be of prognostic value for distant disease-free survival and overall survival in melanoma and breast cancer. The combined expression of three NME1-regulated genes CSFR2B, MSF4A1 and SERPINB9 provided a strongly synergistic correlation with distant disease-free survival in the basal subtype of breast cancer (p<3.5e(-5), hazard ratio=0.33). Our study demonstrates that analysis of NME1-dependent gene expression is a powerful approach for identifying potential modulators of metastatic potential in multiple cancer types, which in turn may represent useful therapeutic targets. The study also highlights NME1-dependent genes as potential prognostic/diagnostic indices, which are profoundly lacking at present in melanoma."
26405583,"Melanoma has a propensity for lymphatogenous metastasis. Improved understanding of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) immunological environment may improve outcomes. The immune phenotype of fresh melanoma SLNs (<i>n</i> = 13) were compared to fresh control lymph nodes (<i>n</i> = 13) using flow cytometry. RNA was isolated from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of the SLN and control lymph node and assessed for Th1/Th2 gene expression pathways using qRT-PCR. In addition, VEGF expression was compared between primary melanoma (<i>n</i> = 6) and benign nevi (<i>n</i> = 6) using immunohistochemistry. Melanoma SLNs had fewer CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to controls (9.2% vs. 19.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.0005). The CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within the SLN appeared to have an exhausted phenotype demonstrated by increased PD-1 mRNA expression (2.2% vs. 0.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and a five-fold increase in CTLA-4 mRNA expression. The SLN also contained an increased number of CD14 (22.7% vs. 7.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and CD68 (9.3% vs. 2.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.001) macrophages, and CD20 B cells (31.1% vs. 20.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.008), suggesting chronic inflammation. RT-PCR demonstrated a significant Th2 bias within the SLN. <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrated a similar Th2 polarization with VEGF treatment of control lymph nodes. The primary melanoma demonstrated strong VEGF expression and an increase in VEGFR1 within the SLN. Melanoma is associated with Th2-mediated ""chronic inflammation,"" fewer cytotoxic T cells, and an exhausted T cell phenotype within the SLN combined with VEGF overproduction by the primary melanoma. These immunologic changes precede nodal metastasis and suggests consideration of VEGF inhibitors in future immunotherapy studies."
19318807,"The expression of SPANX (sperm protein associated with the nucleus in the X chromosome) gene family has been reported in many tumors, such as melanoma, myeloma, glioblastoma, breast carcinoma, ovarian cancer, testicular germ cell tumors, and hematological malignancies. However, no systematic approach has so far been devised to estimate the percentage of cancer cells expressing SPANX. This study was undertaken to quantify the expression of SPANX proteins in melanomas. The expression of SPANX proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in normal skin (n = 12), melanomas (n = 21), and benign nevi (n = 10), using a polyclonal antibody raised in our laboratory. Seventeen of the 21 melanomas (80.9%) examined expressed SPANX proteins. A high percentage of their cells (49.0% +/- 5.5%) stained positively for SPANX proteins compared with no expression found in normal skin cells. Benign nevi had an intermediate number of cells expressing SPANX proteins (25% +/- 8.5%), which resulted significantly higher than normal skin cells and significantly lower than skin melanoma cells. In melanoma cells, the labeling was mostly nuclear, sometimes incomplete or limited to the perinuclear wall, even if cytoplasmic staining was also seen in SPANX-positive tumor cells. In contrast, the 5 of 10 SPANX-positive nevi had a clear nuclear localization of the signal. These data suggest that the SPANX protein family is expressed in the vast majority of the melanomas tested. The mechanism(s), which brings up SPANX gene expression and the role of these proteins are not known."
20484992,"The full molecular consequences of oncogene activation during tumorigenesis are not well understood, but several studies have recently linked oncogene activation to epigenetic silencing of specific genes 1, 2. Transcriptional repressor Id1 is overexpressed in many malignancies including melanoma, and Id1 targets include tumor suppressor genes TSP1, CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN1A (p21), which are frequently epigenetically silenced in cancer. We confirmed that both TSP1 and CDKN2A have abnormal promoter region DNA methylation in primary melanoma, but the mechanism by which this silencing occurs remains unknown. Here we explore the effects of stable lentiviral Id1 overexpression on the expression of these Id1 target genes in human melanoma cell lines. Overexpressed Id1 was functional and bound transcriptional activator E2A, but did not sequester E2A from gene promoters and repress gene expression. Therefore, these Id1 target genes were resistant to Id1-mediated gene silencing. Our results suggest that Id1 activation may need to occur at discrete stages in cooperation with additional gene dysregulation to repress and induce epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes during melanoma progression."
11309305,"Uveal melanoma is the most common form of primary eye cancer. Monosomy 3, which is an unusual finding in tumors but is present in approximately 50% of uveal melanomas, is significantly correlated with metastatic disease. To obtain positional information on putative tumor suppressor genes on this chromosome, we have investigated tumors from 333 patients by comparative genomic hybridization, microsatellite analysis, or conventional karyotype analysis. A partial deletion of the long arm was found in eight tumors, and the smallest region of deletion overlap (SRO) spans 3q24-q26. We found six tumors with a partial deletion of the short arm and were able to define a second SRO of about 2.5 Mb in 3p25. This SRO does not overlap with the VHL gene. Our finding suggests a role for two tumor suppressor genes in metastasizing uveal melanoma and may explain the loss of an entire chromosome 3 in these tumors."
22805320,"Malignant melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer with a variable clinical course even in patients with thin melanomas and localized disease. Despite increasing insights into melanoma biology, no prognostic biomarkers have yet been incorporated into clinical protocols. Reduced expression of the RNA binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) has been shown to correlate with tumour progression and poor prognosis in melanoma and several other cancer forms. In ovarian cancer, an inverse association was found between expression of RBM3 and the minichromosome maintenance 3 (MCM3) gene and protein. In melanoma, gene expression analysis and immunohistochemical validation has uncovered MCM3 as a putative prognostic biomarker. The aim of the present study was to examine the associations of MCM3 expression with clinical outcome and RBM3 expression in a prospective, population-based cohort of melanoma."
17450523,"p14ARF is inactivated by deletions/mutations in many cancer types and can suppress cell growth by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. To identify novel downstream effectors of p14ARF, we used gene expression profiling as a primary screening tool to select candidates for follow up validation studies using in vitro cell-based assays. Gene expression profiles of a panel of 35 melanoma cell lines with either wild-type (n = 12) or mutant (n = 23) p14ARF were compared to identify genes associated with inactivation of p14ARF. Analysis of the microarray data identified 1,316 probe sets that were significantly (p < 0.01) differentially expressed between the p14ARF wild-type and mutant cell lines. Pathway analysis of these genes showed an overrepresentation of many receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways, e.g. TGFbeta, EGF, HGF, PDGF, MAPK, Wnt and integrin pathways. A number of components of these pathways, including FLRT3, RUNX2, MIG-6 and SMURF2 were confirmed as downstream targets of p14ARF using p14ARF-inducible cell lines and RNAi. We propose that regulation of these genes may contribute to melanoma development when p14ARF function is lost."
9617345,"KAI1 is a metastasis suppressor gene for human prostate cancer. To reveal the effect of KAI1 on the in vivo metastasis of tumors other than prostatic cancer, we transfected a human KAI1 cDNA into highly metastatic B16-BL6 murine melanoma cells and established stable transfectant clones with different expression levels of KAI1 message. The following results were obtained with the use of those transfectants. (1) Cell aggregation assay revealed a significantly enhanced Ca(2+)-independent aggregation of B16-BL6 cells by KAI1 cDNA transfection compared with mock transfectants (P < 0.01). (2) The in vivo phagokinetic activity and invasive ability of KAI1 transfectants were clearly decreased as compared with those of mock transfectants (P < 0.01). There was no significant effect of KAI1 expression on the in vitro or in vivo proliferation of B16-BL6 cells. (3) Lung colony formation of intravenously injected KAI1 transfectants in nude mice was significantly reduced as compared with mock transfectants or parental B16-BL6 cells (P < 0.01). These data suggest that KAI1 expression gives rise to the suppression of invasive and metastatic potentials of B16-BL6 cells."
23638671,"Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the most aggressive cancers in dogs and in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms of its development and progression remain unclear. Presently, we examined the expression profile of microRNAs (miRs) in canine oral MM tissues and paired normal oral mucosa tissues by using the microRNA-microarray assay and quantitative RT-PCR. Importantly, a decreased expression of miR-203 was significantly associated with a shorter survival time. Also, miR-203 and -205 were markedly down-regulated in canine and human MM cell lines tested. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of miR-205 had a significant inhibitory effect on the cell growth of canine and human melanoma cells tested by targeting erbb3. Our data suggest that miR-203 is a new prognostic factor in canine oral MMs and that miR-205 functions as a tumour suppressor by targeting erbb3 in both canine and human MM cells."
23221472,"Distinct genetic aberrations between melanomas in different anatomical locations have been confirmed in recent years. However, the associations between immunohistochemical expression, tumor sites, and clinical parameters are not clear. We examined the correlation of protein expression and gene mutation of c-kit with clinicopathological parameters and lesion locations in patients with malignant melanoma (MM). We collected 170 melanocytic lesions, including 106 cutaneous MM from acral melanoma (AM) and nonacral melanoma (NAM) sites, 24 dysplastic nevi, and 40 common melanocytic nevi. Tissue microarray was constructed, and immunohistochemical expression for c-kit was assessed with correlation with clinical parameters. Mutation in exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 of KIT gene in genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction sequencing was also analyzed. Immunostaining scores for c-kit were found to be statistically higher in Dysplastic Nevi than in common melanocytic nevi and MM. In addition, cytoplasmic c-kit staining was significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with AM but not in those with NAM. Twenty-nine cases of MM (including 9 NAM and 20 AM) are analyzed for mutation in exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 of KIT gene in genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction sequencing, and no genetic mutation is found. Our findings confirm that KIT mutations, in contrast to previous white cohorts, are not common in both AM and NAM of the Chinese and do not necessarily correlate with c-kit expression. The significantly different association between the expression of c-kit immunoreactivities and the mortality risks of melanomas on acral versus nonacral sites might change site-specific targeted therapeutic concepts in melanoma in the future."
18066592,"C-kit is a trans-membrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) encoded by the proto-oncogene KIT located at 4q11-12. Gain-of-function mutations arising to c-kit activation independent of its ligand were observed in various tumors related to germ cells, mast cells, and interstitial cells of Cajal. C-kit also participates in melanocyte development; hence, its involvement in oral mucosal melanoma (OMM) tumorigenesis was investigated. Immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis were performed using 18 cases of human primary OMM. Results revealed 16 cases positive to c-kit protein. Atypical melanocytes expressed c-kit. All in situ components expressed c-kit, but only four cases exhibited intense expression in the invasive component. Missense mutations were observed in four cases, and two of those correlated with increased protein expression. C-kit expression in atypical melanocytes suggests the role of c-kit in the early stage of OMM tumorigenesis. C-kit protein expression correlated with activating mutations indicating the pertinent role of the proto-oncogene KIT in the tumorigenesis of OMM."
17891747,"Melanoma is notorious for its high tendency to metastasize and its refractoriness to treatment thereafter. Metastasis is believed to occur mostly through the lymphatic system, and the status of sentinel lymph nodes is currently recognized as the best prognostic indicator. Unfortunately, the lymphatic metastatic process is still poorly understood and the occurrence of sentinel node metastases (micrometastases) may be underestimated. We performed genome-wide gene expression analyses of melanoma lymph node micrometastases and macrometastases, and of primary melanomas and benign naevi, to characterize the early metastatic cells molecularly and to disclose the best diagnostic markers and rational targets for therapy. Significance analysis of microarrays identified 22 over- and five under-expressed genes with > or = four-fold changes in the micrometastases. Of these genes, MLANA, TYR, MIA, ERBB3, PRAME, and SPP1 were tested as potential markers by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In a prospective study of 160 patients, our graded MLANA and TYR RT-PCR analyses disclosed clinically significant metastases, as assessed by disease recurrence, better than histological and immunohistochemical examinations. These results strongly suggest the clinical implementation of quantifiable RT-PCR assays to confirm and complement the pathological examination of sentinel node metastases. Furthermore, SPP1 and PRAME proved valuable as melanoma-specific markers capable of differentiating melanoma cells from benign naevi in the sentinel lymph nodes. Importantly, these two genes may also prove to be ideal targets for drug development and therapy. Most molecular traits of the micrometastases were already present in the primary tumours, suggesting that micrometastasis to sentinel lymph nodes is a fairly non-selective process."
20375924,"Tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (TSLC1) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is involved in the progression of some types of cancer. Several studies have shown that loss of TSLC1 expression is strongly correlated to methylation of the gene promoter, thus leading to poor prognosis in these cancers. However, the role of TSLC1 in cutaneous melanoma (CM) has not been examined. The purpose of this study was to understand the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of TSLC1 inactivation in CM. The expression and promoter methylation of TSLC1 were analyzed in 120 CMs. TSLC1 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry, whereas its methylation status was determined by methylation-specific PCR. TSLC1 expression was lost in 84 of 120 (70%) CMs; 36 (30%) CMs were scored as positive for TSLC1 protein expression. The TSLC1 promoter was methylated in 58 (48.33%) of 120 CMs. The incidence of the loss of expression and methylation of TSLC1 significantly increased as the tumor stage advanced (P=0.032 and 0.0021, respectively). Furthermore, in CM, disease-related survival was significantly shorter in patients with tumors losing TSLC1 or harboring methylated TSLC1 (P=0.0003 and 0.0329, respectively). The epigenetic silencing of TSLC1 through methylation is an important event in the pathogenesis of CM, and TSLC1 provides an indicator for poor prognosis."
20067553,"Melanoma is a cancer with a poorly understood molecular pathobiology. We find the transcription factors PAX3, SOX10, MITF, and the tyrosine kinase receptor MET expressed in melanoma cell lines and primary tumors. Analysis for MET expression in primary tumor specimens showed 27/40 (68%) of the samples displayed an increased expression of MET, and this expression was highly correlated with parallel expression of PAX3, SOX10, and MITF. PAX3 and MITF bind to elements in the MET promoter independently, without evidence of either synergistic activation or inhibition. SOX10 does not directly activate the MET gene alone, but can synergistically activate MET expression with either PAX3 or MITF. In melanoma cells, there was evidence of two pathways for PAX3 mediated MET induction: (i) direct activation of the gene, and (ii) indirect regulation through MITF. SK-MEL23 melanoma cells have both of these pathways intact, while SK-MEL28 melanoma cells only have the first pathway. In summary, we find that PAX3, SOX10 and MITF play an active role in melanoma cells by regulating the MET gene. In consequence, MET promotes the melanoma cancer phenotype by promoting migration, invasion, resistance to apoptosis, and tumor cell growth."

24722418,"The tissue distribution and function of hemoglobin or myoglobin are well known; however, a newly found cytoglobin (CYGB), which also belongs to the globin family, remains to be characterized. To assess its expression in human malignancies, we sought to screen a number of cell lines originated from many tissues using northern blotting and real time PCR techniques. Unexpectedly, we found that several, but not all, melanoma cell lines expressed CYGB mRNA and protein at much higher levels than cells of other origins. Melanocytes, the primary origin of melanoma, also expressed CYGB at a high level. To verify these observations, immunostaining and immunoblotting using anti-CYGB antibody were also performed. Bisulfite-modified genomic sequencing revealed that several melanoma cell lines that abrogated CYGB expression were found to be epigenetically regulated by hypermethylation in the promoter region of CYGB gene. The RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the CYGB transcript in CYGB expression-positive melanoma cell lines resulted in increased proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometric analysis using 2'-, 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), an indicator of reactive oxygen species (ROS), revealed that the cellular ROS level may be involved in the proliferative effect of CYGB. Thus, CYGB appears to play a tumor suppressive role as a ROS regulator, and its epigenetic silencing, as observed in CYGB expression-negative melanoma cell lines, might function as an alternative pathway in the melanocyte-to-melanoma transition."
25174651,"The existence of a dichotomy between immunologically active and quiescent tumor phenotypes has been recently recognized in several types of cancer. The activation of a Th1 type of immune signature has been shown to confer better prognosis and likelihood to respond to immunotherapy. However, whether such dichotomy depends on the genetic make-up of individual cancers is not known yet. BRAF and NRAS mutations are commonly acquired during melanoma progression. Here we explored the role of BRAF and NRAS mutations in influencing the immune phenotype based on a classification previously identified by our group."
22647378,"Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene that inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in colon cancer cells and Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) activity in human mast cells. MITF and β-catenin play a central role in melanocyte and melanoma cell survival, and this study aimed to investigate the effects of HINT1 on the MITF and β-catenin pathways in malignant melanoma cells. We found that HINT1 inhibits MITF and β-catenin transcriptional activity, and both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-HINT1-specific antibody in melanoma cell lines. Stable, constitutive overexpression of the HINT1 protein in human melanoma cells significantly impaired cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. These effects were associated with a decreased expression of cyclin D1 and BCL2, well known MITF and β-catenin transcription targets, respectively. We also demonstrated that BCL2 and cyclin D1 can partially rescue the HINT1-driven phenotype. Moreover, we found in ChIP assays that HINT1 binds the chromatin at MITF and β-catenin sites in BCL2 and cyclin D1 promoters, respectively, and that mSIN3a and HDAC1, well known transcriptional repressors, can be co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-HINT1-specific antibody. These findings support the tumor suppressor activity of HINT1 gene in melanoma cells by promoting the formation of non-functional complexes with oncogenic transcription factors like MITF and β-catenin."
23863473,"Numerous studies have indicated that the serum levels of microRNAs are useful for the diagnosis or evaluation of activity in human diseases. However, determining the level of only one of the nearly 2000 microRNAs identified so far may be less significant. Accordingly, we examined the possibility that the expression pattern of multiple microRNAs in each patient may be a more reliable disease marker for melanoma, especially metastatic disease, focusing on the interaction among microRNAs. Six microRNAs (miR-9, miR-145, miR-150, miR-155, miR-203, and miR-205) were evaluated using real-time PCR in 11 patients with metastatic melanoma and in 16 patients without melanoma. The expression of the six microRNAs was significantly different between the patients with metastasis and those without it. MiR-9 and miR-205 and miR-203 and miR-205 showed significant correlations, and the combination of miR-9, miR-145, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-205 was more sensitive than when each miR was used individually to distinguish the patients with metastasis from those without it. This is the first report demonstrating the expression profiles of multiple microRNAs in melanoma patients. Clarifying the involvement of the microRNA network in the pathogenesis of melanoma may contribute to the development of new diagnostic tools and to advancing the understanding of this disease."
19578755,"Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been detected in cancer, suggesting that these small non-coding RNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. In the present study, we investigated the expression of miRNA-17-5p, miRNA-18a, miRNA-20a, miRNA-92a, miRNA-146a, miRNA-146b and miRNA-155 by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in a panel of melanocyte cultures and melanoma cell lines and explored the possible role of miRNA-155 in melanoma cell proliferation and survival. The analyzed miRNAs were selected on the basis of previous studies strongly supporting their involvement in cancer development and/or progression. We found that miRNA-17-5p, miRNA-18a, miRNA-20a, and miRNA-92a were overexpressed, whereas miRNA-146a, miRNA-146b and miRNA-155 were down-regulated in the majority of melanoma cell lines with respect to melanocytes. Ectopic expression of miRNA-155 significantly inhibited proliferation in 12 of 13 melanoma cell lines with reduced levels of this miRNA and induced apoptosis in 4 out of 4 cell lines analyzed. In conclusion, our data further support the finding of altered miRNA expression in melanoma cells and establish for the first time that miRNA-155 is a negative regulator of melanoma cell proliferation and survival."
12650606,"This article reviews information related to the BRMS1 (BReast Metastasis Suppressor 1) metastasis suppressor gene. BRMS1 was identified by differential display comparing metastasis-suppressed chromosome 11 hybrids with metastatic, parental MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells. BRMS1 has subsequently been shown to suppress metastasis, but not tumorigenicity of human melanoma cells. The murine version, Brms1, also suppresses metastasis and exhibits a high level of homology to the human gene at the structure, nucleotide and amino acid levels. The mechanisms of action remain to be determined; however, BRMS1 transfectant cells have restored gap junctional intercellular communication. Recent data suggest that BRMS1 is part of the mSin3A histone deacetylase complex."
24697775,"Ocular melanoma is a rare subtype of melanoma, which includes uveal melanoma (UM) and conjunctival melanoma. UM is associated with an increased risk of cutaneous melanoma (CM) in addition to mesothelioma, skin lesions such as epithelioid atypical Spitz tumors, and other internal malignancies due to a germline mutation of the BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) gene. Such familial risks are important for dermatologists to recognize when screening patients with a history of UM for CM and other malignancies. Molecular genetics further help to elucidate the connections between UM and CM by revealing similarities and differences in important mutations among the melanoma subtypes. Both UM and CM have been shown to harbor germline mutation of BAP1. However, somatic mutations in either GNAQ or GNA11 are unique to UM tumors and could be used as potential markers to differentiate UM from metastatic CM and act as direct therapeutic targets. However, CM-associated BRAF and CDKN2A mutations are rare in UM. This review addresses the clinical features, pathogenesis, and current treatment options of UM, focusing on UM and the BAP1 cancer syndrome to raise awareness of ocular melanoma and its greater role in the predisposition to a hereditary cancer syndrome."
27123562,"Frequent mutations have been described in the following 5 genes in uveal melanoma (UM): BAP1, EIF1AX, GNA11, GNAQ, and SF3B1. Understanding the prognostic significance of these mutations could facilitate their use in precision medicine."
16964280,"We have isolated a gene (WS5) that is specifically expressed at the mRNA and protein level in avian fibroblasts transformed by the v-myc oncogene of avian acute leukemia virus MC29. In a conditional cell transformation system, WS5 gene expression was tightly correlated with v-myc activation. The WS5 gene contains 11 exons, encoding a 733-amino acid protein with a transmembrane region and a polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain. Near the transcriptional start site, the WS5 promoter contains a cluster of four binding sites for the Myc-Max complex and a binding site for transcription factor C/EBPalpha. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Myc, Max and C/EBPalpha bind specifically to these sites. Functional promoter analyses revealed that both the Myc-binding site cluster and the C/EBPalpha-binding site are essential for strong transcriptional activation, and that Myc and C/EBPalpha synergistically activate the WS5 promoter. Ectopic expression of WS5 led to cell transformation documented by anchorage-independent growth. The human melanoma antigen Pmel17, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, is the mammalian protein with the highest amino acid sequence identity (38%) to WS5. The Pmel17 gene is regulated by the MITF protein, a bHLHZip transcription factor with DNA binding specificities similar to those of Myc/Max. WS5 is also related to human glycoprotein GPNMB expressed in metastatic melanoma cells and implicated in the progression of brain and liver tumors."
18385040,"Recently, a segregation study in families with uveal and cutaneous melanoma identified 9q21 as a potential locus harboring a tumor-suppressor gene (TSG). One of the genes in this area, RASEF, was then analyzed as a candidate TSG, but lack of point mutations and copy number changes could not confirm this. In this study, the RASEF gene was investigated for potential mutations and gene silencing by promoter methylation in uveal melanoma."
17351674,"Changes in CDKN2a gene are known to be linked with sporadic melanoma and hereditary predisposition to this cancer. In the Polish population mutations in the coding region of the CDKN2a gene are rather rare, therefore the attention has been focused on polymorphisms and alterations in uncoding regions such as 3' UTR. The aim of this study was to analyze two common polymorphisms, Ala148Thr and 500 C/G, and correlate them with the clinical course of melanoma. DNA from 285 patients was analyzed and found polymorphisms were correlated with the clinical parameters employing statistical methods. The obtained results allow us to conclude: (i) survival times of 500 C/G carriers vs. cumulating proportion surviving was not statistically significant; (ii) CDKN2a polymorphism 500 C/G correlated with Ala148Thr; (iii) no correlation was observed between the 500 C/G polymorphism and age of diagnosis, localization of primary melanoma and survival time; (iv) we did not find correlation between 500 C/G and type of cancer in the family; (v) changes in the CDKN2a gene were not found in patients with second cancer."
27153441,"Sinonasal melanomas are rare neoplasms with poor prognosis that may harbor KIT and NRAS genes mutations. Molecular alterations represent possible targets of tailored therapeutic approaches. We describe the case of a 74-year-old patient with primary melanoma of the nasal cavity. Mutational analysis of KIT demonstrated a point missense mutation D820G in exon 17. This represents, to our knowledge, the first case of sinonasal melanoma harboring this specific KIT mutation. Although KIT mutations confer sensibility to thyrosine-kinase inhibitor, it has been proved that this is strongly dependent on the region in which this alteration occurs. Thus it seems very important to perform an accurate gene mutational analysis to provide a biological rationale to the tailored therapy."
15867352,"Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) functions as a metastasis suppressor gene in breast cancer and melanoma cell lines, but the mechanism of BRMS1 suppression remains unclear. We determined that BRMS1 expression was inversely correlated with that of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a prometastatic gene that is regulated at least in part by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). To further investigate the role of NF-kappaB in BRMS1-regulated gene expression, we examined NF-kappaB binding activity and found an inverse correlation between BRMS1 expression and NF-kappaB binding activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and C8161.9 melanoma cells stably expressing BRMS1. In contrast, BRMS1 expression had no effect on activation of the activator protein-1 transcription factor. Further, we showed that suppression of both constitutive and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation by BRMS1 may be due to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation. To examine the relationship between BRMS1 and uPA expression in primary breast tumors, we screened a breast cancer dot blot array of normalized cDNA from 50 breast tumors and corresponding normal breast tissues. There was a significant reduction in BRMS1 mRNA expression in breast tumors compared with matched normal breast tissues (paired t test, P < 0.0001) and a general inverse correlation with uPA gene expression (P < 0.01). These results suggest that at least one of the underlying mechanisms of BRMS1-dependent suppression of tumor metastasis includes inhibition of NF-kappaB activity and subsequent suppression of uPA expression in breast cancer and melanoma cells."
18515281,"Raf kinase trapping to Golgi (RKTG) is a newly characterized negative regulator of the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-signaling pathway via sequestrating Raf-1 to the Golgi apparatus. Among Raf kinase family members, B-Raf is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers and an activated B-Raf mutation V600E is associated with >60% of human melanomas. Here, we show that RKTG can also bind and translocate B-Raf to the Golgi apparatus. When overexpressed in A375, a human malignant melanoma cell line with B-Raf(V600E), RKTG inhibits ERK activation, cell proliferation and transformation of A375 cells. In addition, the tumorigenicity of the RKTG-expressing A375 cells is suppressed in nude mice. Consistently, cell proliferation rate was reduced in the tumor xenografts in which RKTG was overexpressed. Collectively, our results suggest that RKTG may play a suppressive role in human melanoma that harbors an oncogenic B-Raf mutation via its antagonistic action on B-Raf."
21268068,"Melanoma is the most lethal form of human skin cancer. However, only limited chemotherapy is currently available for the metastatic stage of the disease. Since chemotherapy, radiation and sodium arsenite treatment operate mainly through induction of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, a strongly decreased mitochondrial function in metastatic melanoma cells, could be responsible for low efficacy of the conventional therapy of melanoma. Another feature of metastatic melanoma cells is their proinflammatory phenotype, linked to endogenous expression of the inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα IL6 and IL8, their receptors, and constitutive NF-κB- and STAT3-dependent gene expression, including cyclooxygenase-2 (PTGS2/COX2). In the present study, we treated melanoma cells with immunological (monoclonal antibody against TNFα or IL6), pharmacological (small molecular inhibitors of IKKβ-NF-κB and JAK2-STAT3) or genetic (specific RNAi for COX-2) agents that suppressed the inflammatory response in combination with induction of apoptosis via TRAIL. As a result of these combined treatments, exogenous TRAIL via interactions with TRAIL-R2/R1 strongly increased levels of apoptosis in resistant melanoma cells. The present study provides new understanding of the regulation of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in melanoma and will serve as the foundation for the potential development of a novel approach for a therapy of resistant melanomas."
17975146,"The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is regarded as a key oncogene of the melanocytic lineage since it was detected by a genome-wide analysis to be strongly amplified in 15% to 20% of metastatic melanomas. MITF gene amplification was shown to be associated with a reduced survival in metastatic melanoma patients, and reduction of MITF activity was shown to sensitize melanoma cell lines to chemotherapeutics, suggesting the intratumoral MITF gene copy number as a predictive biomarker of response and survival after chemotherapy."
22131135,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Hsa-miR-9 has been shown to have opposite functions in different tumour types; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we show that hsa-miR-9 is down-regulated in metastatic melanomas compared to primary melanomas. Overexpression of miR-9 in melanoma cells resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation and migratory capacity with decreased F-actin polymerization and down-regulation of multiple GTPases involved in cytoskeleton remodelling. miR-9 overexpression induced significant down-regulation of Snail1 with a concomitant increase in E-cadherin expression. In contrast, knockdown of miR-9 increased Snail1 expression as well as melanoma cell proliferation and migration capacity. Mechanistically, miR-9 expression down-regulated NF-κB1 in melanoma and the effect was abolished by mutations in the putative miR-9 binding sites within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of NF-κB1. Anti-miR-9 miRNA inhibitor also increased the expression of NF-κB1. The effects of miR-9 on Snail1 expression and melanoma cell proliferation and migration were rescued by overexpression of NF-κB1 in these cells. Furthermore, miR-9 overexpression resulted in significantly decreased melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo. In summary, miR-9 inhibits melanoma proliferation and metastasis through down-regulation of the NF-κB1-Snail1 pathway. This study finds a new mechanism that miR-9 utilizes to decrease E-cadherin expression and inhibit melanoma progression. The results suggest that function of microRNAs is context and tumour type-specific."
19638168,"WT1, first recognized as a tumor suppressor gene involved in the development of Wilms' tumor, may have apparently contradictory findings and functions. As WT1 has been identified as a molecular target for cancer immunotherapy, immunodetection of WT1 in tumor cells has become an essential step in cancer studies."
16818621,"Activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS oncogenes in human melanomas are mutually exclusive. This finding has suggested an epistatic relationship but is consistent even with synthetic lethality. To evaluate the latter possibility, a mutated NRAS(Q61R) oncogene was expressed, under a constitutive or a doxycycline-regulated promoter, in a metastatic melanoma clone (clone 21) harboring an activated BRAF(V600E) oncogene. After the first 10 to 12 in vitro passages, the constitutive NRAS(Q61R) transfectant displayed progressive accumulation in G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle and stained for the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity (SA-beta-Gal). Inducible expression of NRAS(Q61R), by the Tet-Off system, in clone 21 cells (21NRAS(61ON)) led to overactivation of the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and, after the 10th in vitro passage, led to promotion of senescence. This was documented by reduced proliferation, flattened cell morphology, reduced growth in Matrigel, positive staining for SA-beta-Gal, and expression of AMP-activated protein kinase and of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(waf1/Cip1). These effects were detected neither in 21 cells with silenced NRAS(Q61R) (21NRAS(61OFF)) nor in cells transfected with an inducible wild-type NRAS gene (21NRAS(WTON)). In addition, when compared with parental 21 cells, or with 21NRAS(61OFF), 21NRAS(61ON) and constitutive NRAS(Q61R) transfectants cells showed increased susceptibility to cytotoxicity by both HLA class I antigen-restricted and nonspecific T cells and up-regulation of several MHC class I antigen processing machinery components. These results suggest a relationship of synthetic lethality between NRAS and BRAF oncogenes, leading to selection against ""double-mutant"" cells."
15221796,"Several variant forms of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R) have been associated with red hair, fair skin and an increased risk for melanoma. Their involvement in melanoma susceptibility is apparently linked both to skin sensitivity and to non-pigmentary pathways. We investigated the frequency of the MC1R variants in the Italian region of Liguria, where the occurrence and penetrance of melanoma are low and primary susceptibility is characterized by prevalence of the CDKN2A c.301G>T [p.G101W] founder mutation. Additionally, we attempted to establish the frequency of the red hair/fair skin phenotype in our region. As predicted by anecdotal evidence, the frequency of red hair/phototype I was very low (0.7%). Screening of 17 red-haired individuals and their red-haired relatives, 207 controls and 214 melanoma patients unselected for hair color but all of Ligurian descent, led to the detection of 8 novel substitutions (c.133T>C [p.F45L], c.248C>T [p.S83L], c.332C>T [p. A111V], c.479G>A [p.R160Q], c.637C>T [p.R213W], c.793G>A [p. V265I], c.923C>T [p. T308M], c.943T>C [p.C315R]), 1 novel deletion (c.520_523delGTC [p.V174del]) and 3 novel synonymous variants (c.366G>C [p. V122V], c.684G>A [p. Q228Q], c.726C>T [p.T241T]). Preliminary genotype/phenotype correlation seems to indicate that other genes involved in the regulation of human pigmentation may mask the recessive action of high-penetrance MC1R alleles, thus determining the low frequency of at-risk phototypes and of incidence and/or penetrance of melanoma in Liguria."
23659246,"Although ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure from indoor tanning has been linked to an increased risk of melanoma, the role of DNA repair genes in this process is unknown. We evaluated the association of 92 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 20 DNA repair genes with the risk of melanoma and indoor tanning among 929 patients with melanoma and 817 controls from the Minnesota Skin Health Study. Significant associations with melanoma risk were identified for SNPs in ERCC4, ERCC6, RFC1, XPC, MGMT, and FBRSL1 genes; with a cutoff of P < 0.05. ERCC6 and FBRSL1 gene variants and haplotypes interacted with indoor tanning. However, none of the 92 SNPs tested met the correction criteria for multiple comparisons. This study, based on an a priori interest in investigating the role of DNA repair capacity using variants in base excision and nucleotide excision repair, identified several genes that may play a role in resolving UV-induced DNA damage."
21642878,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the development of cancers including malignant melanoma (MM) and breast cancer. We tested the possible association of MMP1 and MMP8 gene variation with these two types of cancer. We genotyped 300 unselected patients with MM, 300 consecutive breast cancer cases, 300 controls for melanoma, and 300 controls for breast cancer (age-matched and sex-matched healthy adults with negative cancer family histories). Our study showed that the MMP8 gene rs11225395 polymorphism was associated with the risk of developing MM (odds ratio: 1.69; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-2.80; P=0.040) for the A/A genotype and 1.49 (95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.17; P=0.035) for the A/G genotype compared with the G/G genotype. The A allele was over-represented among MM cases compared with controls (odds ratio=1.54; P=0.017). In-vitro assays showed that the A allele had a higher promoter activity than the G allele in melanoma cells. No association was detected between this variant and breast cancer susceptibility. We found no strong association between MMP1 variation and the risk of MM or breast cancer. The finding of this study indicates an influence of MMP8 gene variation on melanoma susceptibility."
19404918,"Mutational activation of the MAP kinase pathway is frequently found in many types of cancer. Recently, activating mutations in the BRAF gene, an important activator of this pathway, have been described in several tumor types including melanoma, colorectal and papillary thyroid cancer. The most frequent mutation in exon 15 (V600E) as well as several other mutations within exons 11 and 15 result in constitutive activation of the oncoprotein."
22230721,DNA repair pathway genes play an important role in maintaining genomic integrity and protecting against cancer development. This study aimed to identify novel SNPs in the DNA repair-related genes associated with melanoma risk from a genome-wide association study (GWAS).
18442402,"The process of malignant transformation, progression and metastasis of melanoma is poorly understood. Gene expression profiling of human cancer has allowed for a unique insight into the genes that are involved in these processes. Thus, we have attempted to utilize this approach through the analysis of a series of primary, non-metastatic cutaneous tumors and metastatic melanoma samples."
15760917,"We studied global gene expression in three melanoma cell lines with the most common and potent V600E mutation in the B-RAF gene-four cell lines with a common Q61R mutation in the N-RAS gene and three cell lines with no mutations using human HG-U133A 2.0 micro-arrays with 22 277 transcripts. Data analysis using stringent criteria revealed several upregulated and downregulated genes in cell lines with B-RAF and N-RAS mutations compared with cell lines without mutations. We found 29 genes specifically upregulated and 32 genes downregulated in cell lines with B-RAF mutations, whereas 70 genes were upregulated and 39 downregulated in cell lines with N-RAS mutations; 11 genes showed overlapping upregulation and 45 downregulation. The micro-array data for nine selected genes were validated by the real-time PCR technique. Expression of a large number of genes, that encode members or regulators of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways or are involved in metastasis or invasion, was affected in cell lines with mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS. Upregulated genes in cell lines with mutations included dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), sprouty 2 (SPRY2), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 (AKT3) and matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14); downregulated genes included interleukin 18 (IL18), Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) and inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2). Our results, though carried on cell lines, provide a novel insight into the effect of mutations in the B-RAF and N-RAS genes on global gene expression in melanoma and highlight the complexity of mechanisms involved in tumour initiation and maintenance."
23348506,"Systematic sequencing of human cancer genomes has identified many recurrent mutations in the protein-coding regions of genes but rarely in gene regulatory regions. Here, we describe two independent mutations within the core promoter of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which collectively occur in 50 of 70 (71%) melanomas examined. These mutations generate de novo consensus binding motifs for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, and in reporter assays, the mutations increased transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by two- to fourfold. Examination of 150 cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 24 cases (16%), with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus, somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism."
21963849,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inducing kinase (NIK) is a MAP3K that regulates the activation of NF-κB. NIK is often highly expressed in tumor cells, including melanoma, but the significance of this in melanoma progression has been unclear. Tissue microarray analysis of NIK expression reveals that dysplastic nevi (n=22), primary (n=15) and metastatic melanoma (n=13) lesions showed a statistically significant elevation in NIK expression when compared with benign nevi (n=30). Moreover, when short hairpin RNA techniques were used to knock-down NIK, the resultant NIK-depleted melanoma cell lines exhibited decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, delayed cell cycle progression and reduced tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. As expected, when NIK was depleted there was decreased activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, whereas canonical NF-κB activation remained intact. NIK depletion also resulted in reduced expression of genes that contribute to tumor growth, including CXCR4, c-MYC and c-MET, and pro-survival factors such as BCL2 and survivin. These changes in gene expression are not fully explained by the attenuation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Shown here for the first time is the demonstration that NIK modulates β-catenin-mediated transcription to promote expression of survivin. NIK-depleted melanoma cells exhibited downregulation of survivin as well as other β-catenin regulated genes including c-MYC, c-MET and CCND2. These data indicate that NIK mediates both β-catenin and NF-κB regulated transcription to modulate melanoma survival and growth. Thus, NIK may be a promising therapeutic target for melanoma."
25001534,"First identified almost two decades ago as a novel gene differentially expressed in human melanoma cells induced to terminally differentiate, MDA-7/IL-24 has since shown great potential as an anti-cancer gene. MDA-7/IL24, a secreted protein of the IL-10 family, functions as a cytokine at normal physiological levels and is expressed in tissues of the immune system. At supra-physiological levels, MDA-7/IL-24 plays a prominent role in inhibiting tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis and was recently shown to target tumor stem/initiating cells for death. Much of the attention focused on MDA-7/IL-24 originated from the fact that it can selectively induce cell death in cancer cells without affecting normal cells. Thus, this gene originally shown to be associated with melanoma cell differentiation has now proven to be a multi-functional protein affecting a broad array of cancers. Moreover, MDA-7/IL-24 has proven efficacious in a Phase I/II clinical trial in humans with multiple advanced cancers. As research in the field progresses, we will unravel more of the functions of MDA-7/IL-24 and define novel ways to utilize MDA-7/IL-24 in the treatment of cancer."
21788308,"RASSF1A gene, found at the 3p21.3 locus, is a tumor suppressor gene frequently hypermethylated in human cancers. In this study, we report that compared with melanocytes in normal choroid, RASSF1A is downregulated in uveal melanoma samples and in uveal melanoma cell lines. LOH at 3p21.3 was detected in 50% of uveal melanoma. Moreover, methylation of the RASSF1A promoter was detected in 35 of 42 tumors (83%) and RASSF1A was also weakly expressed at the mRNA level. These data indicate that LOH at the RASSF1A locus or RASSF1A promoter methylation may partly account for the suppression of RASSF1A expression observed in uveal melanoma. Furthermore, following ectopic expression in three RASSF1A-deficient melanoma cell lines (OCM-1, Mel270, and 92.1), RASSF1A weakly reduces cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of uveal melanoma cells without effect on ERK1/2 activation, cyclin D1 and p27(Kip1) expression. This study explored biological functions and underlying mechanisms of RASSF1A in the ERK1/2 pathway in normal uveal melanocytes. We showed that siRNA-mediated depletion of RASSF1A increased ERK1/2 activation, cyclin D1 expression, and also decreased p27(Kip1) expression in normal uveal melanocytes. Moreover, that the depletion of RASSF1A induced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and increased p21(Cip1) expression suggests that RASSF1A plays a role in the escape of cellular senescence in normal uveal melanocytes. Interestingly, we found that RASSF1A was epigenetically inactivated in long-term culture of uveal melanocytes. Taken together, these data show that depletion of RASSF1A could be an early event observed during senescence of normal uveal melanocytes and that additional alterations are acquired during malignant transformation to uveal melanoma."
19799645,"Utilizing gene microarray profiling of melanoma samples, we have recently identified a novel gene overexpressed in both thick primary and metastatic melanomas. This gene, progestagen-associated endometrial protein (PAEP), has never before been implicated in the oncogenic processes of melanoma, with its true function in oncogenesis and tumour progression relatively unknown. Overexpression of the PAEP gene in freshly procured thick primary and metastatic melanoma samples (58%) and daughter cell lines (77%) is confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and mass spectrometric analysis. We suggest that PAEP gene overexpression is involved with melanoma tumour progression as well as an aggressive phenotype. Transfection of melanoma cells with PAEP small interfering RNA (siRNA) reveals a significant decrease in soft agar colony formation and a marked inhibition of both cell migration and cell invasion. Furthermore, we establish stable melanoma transfectants via PAEP lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA), examine their growth characteristics in a murine xenograft model and reveal that tumour growth is significantly inhibited in two separate melanoma cell lines. Our data strongly implicate the PAEP gene as a tumour growth promoter with oncogenic properties and a potential therapeutic target for patients with advanced melanoma."

Ipilimumab (Yervoy, BMS), another anti-CTLA-4 antibody, is approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA). Biomarkers are needed to identify the subset of patients who will achieve tumor control with CTLA-4 blockade."
24289491,"Expression profiling of microRNAs in melanoma lesional skin biopsies compared with normal donor skin biopsies, as well as melanoma cell lines compared with normal melanocytes, revealed that hsa-miR-206 was down-regulated in melanoma (-75.4-fold, P = 1.7 × 10(-4)). MiR-206 has been implicated in a large number of cancers, including breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancers; however, its role in tumor development remains largely unknown, its biologic function is poorly characterized, and its targets affecting cancer cells are largely unknown. MiR-206 reduced growth and migration/invasion of multiple melanoma cell lines. Bioinformatics identified cell cycle genes CDK2, CDK4, Cyclin C, and Cyclin D1 as strong candidate targets. Western blots and 3'UTR reporter gene assays revealed that miR-206 inhibited translation of CDK4, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin C. Additionally, hsa-miR-206 transfection induced G1 arrest in multiple melanoma cell lines. These observations support hsa-miR-206 as a tumor suppressor in melanoma and identify Cyclin C, Cyclin D1, and CDK4 as miR-206 targets."
25289082,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are novel regulators in cancer biology. BRAF-activated lncRNA (BANCR) is overexpressed in melanoma and has a potential functional role in melanoma cell migration. However, little is known about the role of BANCR in the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In the present study, BANCR expression was examined in six pairs of PTC and matched adjacent normal tissues. The results revealed that BANCR levels were significantly higher in the PTC tissues and PTC IHH-4 cells compared with the normal controls. Knockdown of BANCR in the IHH-4 cells inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis of the cells <i>in vitro</i>. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that BANCR markedly activated autophagy. Overexpression of BANCR inhibited apoptosis in the IHH-4 cells, whereas inhibition of autophagy stimulated apoptosis in the BANCR-overexpressed cells. BANCR overexpression also increased cell proliferation and the inhibition of autophagy abrogated BANCR overexpression-induced cell proliferation. In addition, the overexpression of BANCR resulted in an increase in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, a marker for autophagy, while the knockdown of BANCR decreased the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. These results revealed that BANCR expression levels are upregulated in PTC. Additionally, BANCR increases PTC cell proliferation, which could activate autophagy."
9445187,"There is increasing evidence that mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are among the most common genetic alterations in human malignancies. Because ultraviolet light can induce specific p53 mutations and is linked to the development of skin cancers, this study was done to determine the significance of p53 protein (p53p) overexpression in melanomas originating at different cutaneous sites varying in frequency of sunlight exposure."
11238948,"The frequent loss of both INK4a and ARF in melanoma raises the question of which INK4a-ARF gene product functions to suppress melanoma genesis in vivo. Moreover, the high incidence of INK4a-ARF inactivation in transformed melanocytes, along with the lack of p53 mutation, implies a cell type-specific role for INK4a-ARF that may not be complemented by other lesions of the RB and p53 pathways. A mouse model of cutaneous melanoma has been generated previously through the combined effects of INK4a(Delta2/3) deficiency (null for INK4a and ARF) and melanocyte-specific expression of activated RAS (tyrosinase-driven H-RAS(V12G), Tyr-RAS). In this study, we made use of this Tyr-RAS allele to determine whether activated RAS can cooperate with p53 loss in melanoma genesis, whether such melanomas are biologically comparable to those arising in INK4a(Delta2/3-/-) mice, and whether tumor-associated mutations emerge in the p16(INK4a)-RB pathway in such melanomas. Here, we report that p53 inactivation can cooperate with activated RAS to promote the development of cutaneous melanomas that are clinically indistinguishable from those arisen on the INK4a(Delta2/3) null background. Genomewide analysis of RAS-induced p53 mutant melanomas by comparative genomic hybridization and candidate gene surveys revealed alterations of key components governing RB-regulated G(1)/S transition, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, cdc25a, and p21(CIP1). Consistent with the profile of c-Myc dysregulation, the reintroduction of p16(INK4a) profoundly reduced the growth of Tyr-RAS INK4a(Delta2/3-/-) tumor cells but had no effect on tumor cells derived from Tyr-RAS p53(-/-) melanomas. Together, these data validate a role for p53 inactivation in melanomagenesis and suggest that both the RB and p53 pathways function to suppress melanocyte transformation in vivo in the mouse."
21466784,"Elafin, a serine protease inhibitor, induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in human melanoma cells, where its expression is transcriptionally silenced. However, it remains unknown how the elafin gene is repressed in melanoma cells. We here demonstrate that elafin expression is modulated via epigenetically regulated expression of the transcription factor Foxa2. Treatment of melanoma cells with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor induced elafin expression, which was specifically responsible for reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Suppression of Foxa2 transcription, mediated by DNA hypermethylation in its promoter region, was released in melanoma cells upon treatment with the demethylating agent. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that the Foxa2 binding site in the elafin promoter was critical for the activation of the promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further showed that Foxa2 bound to the elafin promoter in vivo. Analyses of melanoma cells with varied levels of Foxa2 revealed a correlated expression between Foxa2 and elafin and the ability of Foxa2 to induce apoptosis. Our results collectively suggest that, in melanoma cells, Foxa2 expression is silenced and therefore elafin is maintained unexpressed to facilitate cell proliferation in the disease melanoma."
20357817,"Malignant cutaneous melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. Despite improvements in early melanoma diagnosis, the 5-year survival rate remains low in advanced disease. Therefore, novel biomarkers are urgently needed to devise new means of detection and treatment. In this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of microRNA (miRNA) deregulation in melanoma development and their impact on patient survival. Global miRNA expression profiles of a set of melanoma lymph node metastases, melanoma cell lines, and melanocyte cultures were determined using Agilent array. Deregulated miRNAs were evaluated in relation with clinical characteristics, patient survival, and mutational status for BRAF and NRAS. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed between melanocytes and melanomas as well as melanoma cell lines. In melanomas, miR-193a, miR-338, and miR-565 were underexpressed in cases with a BRAF mutation. Furthermore, low expression of miR-191 and high expression of miR-193b were associated with poor melanoma-specific survival. In conclusion, our findings show miRNA dysregulation in malignant melanoma and its relation to established molecular backgrounds of BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations. The identification of an miRNA classifier for poor survival may lead to the development of miRNA detection as a complementary prognostic tool in clinical practice."
18672145,"Approximately 5% to 10% of cases of cutaneous melanoma occur in families that have a hereditary predisposition for this disease. In 20% to 40% of such melanoma families, germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene have been identified. Apart from a high risk of melanoma, a proportion of kindreds that have familial melanoma also have an increased risk of pancreatic carcinoma. Guidelines for management of familial melanoma and the issue of genetic testing for CDKN2A germline mutations are discussed."
20060810,"The Forkhead/Fox transcription factor Foxc2 is a critical regulator of vascular development. However, the role of Foxc2 in pathological angiogenesis in cancer remains unknown. Here we show that FoxC2 is highly expressed in human breast and colonic tumors and in the tumor endothelium in human and mouse melanomas. Using the B16 melanoma tumor model, we investigated the function of Foxc2 in tumor angiogenesis. After subcutaneous injection of B16 melanoma cells, primary tumor growth as well as neovascularization was markedly reduced in mice lacking one copy of the Foxc2 gene (Foxc2+/-). Consistently, expression levels of several angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf), matrix metallopeptidase 2 (Mmp2), and platelet-derived growth factor-B (Pdgfb), were significantly decreased in B16 tumors grown in Foxc2+/- mice, and tumor blood vessels formed in Foxc2+/- mice showed reduced coverage of mural cells and endothelial cell apoptosis. In addition, the tumor tissue in Foxc2+/- mice had an accumulation of necrotic cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that haplodeficiency of Foxc2 results in impaired formation of tumor blood vessels as well as reduced tumor growth and thereby provide evidence that Foxc2 is critical for tumor development and angiogenesis."
19118061,"Recently, gene amplification and overexpression of KIT as well as activating mutations in the KIT gene have been described to occur in certain subsets of melanoma. These findings suggest KIT as a potential target for therapy with imatinib mesylate in these melanomas. To date, data on the KIT status in uveal melanoma (UM) is limited."
22095472,"The contribution of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene variants to the development of early-onset melanoma is unknown. Using an Australian population-based, case-control-family study, we sequenced MC1R for 565 cases with invasive cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between ages 18 and 39 years, 409 unrelated controls and 518 sibling controls. Variants were classified a priori into ""R"" variants (D84E, R142H, R151C, I155T, R160W, D294H) and ""r"" variants (all other nonsynonymous variants). We estimated odds ratios (OR) for melanoma using unconditional (unrelated controls) and conditional (sibling controls) logistic regression. The prevalence of having at least one R or r variant was 86% for cases, 73% for unrelated controls and 81% for sibling controls. R151C conferred the highest risk (per allele OR 2.57, 95% confidence interval 1.86-3.56 for the case-unrelated-control analysis and 1.70 (1.12-2.60) for the case-sibling-control analysis). When mutually adjusted, the ORs per R allele were 2.23 (1.77-2.80) and 2.06 (1.47-2.88), respectively, from the two types of analysis, and the ORs per r allele were 1.69 (1.33-2.13) and 1.25 (0.88-1.79), respectively. The associations were stronger for men and those with none or few nevi or with high childhood sun exposure. Adjustment for phenotype, nevi and sun exposure attenuated the overall log OR for R variants by approximately 18% but had lesser influence on r variant risk estimates. MC1R variants explained about 21% of the familial aggregation of melanoma. Some MC1R variants are important determinants of early-onset melanoma. The strength of association with melanoma differs according to the type and number of variants."
24709888,"RNA splicing is the cellular process that has only recently been found to be an important target for various cancers. Among the spliceosome genes that are involved in cancers, SF3B1 is most frequently mutated. Recurrent mutation in codon 625 has been found in uveal melanoma, but this mutation has not been identified in cutaneous melanoma. We used whole-exome sequencing to explore the mutational landscape of 295 melanoma samples, 231 of which are cutaneous melanoma. Among these cutaneous melanoma samples, we found two samples with R625 mutation in SF3B1 gene. The results were validated by Sanger sequencing. We conclude that SF3B1 R625 mutation does occur in cutaneous melanoma, although with a low frequency (∼1%)."
10362803,"Fas (Apo-1/CD95) is a cell-surface receptor involved in cell death signaling. The key role of the Fas system in negative growth regulation has been studied mostly within the immune system, and somatic mutations of Fas gene in cancer patients have been described solely in lymphoid-lineage malignancies. However, many nonlymphoid tumor cells have been found to be resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis, which suggests that Fas mutations, one of the possible mechanisms for Fas resistance, may be involved in the pathogenesis of nonlymphoid malignancies as well. In this study, we have analyzed the entire coding region and all splice sites of the Fas gene for the detection of the gene mutations in 44 human malignant melanomas in skin by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and DNA sequencing. Overall, 3 tumors (6.8%) were found to have the Fas mutations, which were all missense variants and identified in the cytoplasmic region (death domain) known to be involved in the transduction of an apoptotic signal. The data presented here suggest that somatic alterations of the Fas gene might lead to the loss of its apoptotic function and contribute to the pathogenesis of some human malignant melanomas."
15277467,An activating mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene has been found in a high proportion of cutaneous melanomas and cutaneous nevi but not in uveal melanoma. Conjunctival melanoma shows greater clinical similarity to cutaneous melanoma than does uveal melanoma. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the T1799A BRAF mutation found in cutaneous melanoma is also present in conjunctival melanoma.
26842708,"Hotspot mutations in the spliceosome gene SF3B1 are reported in ∼20% of uveal melanomas. SF3B1 is involved in 3'-splice site (3'ss) recognition during RNA splicing; however, the molecular mechanisms of its mutation have remained unclear. Here we show, using RNA-Seq analyses of uveal melanoma, that the SF3B1(R625/K666) mutation results in deregulated splicing at a subset of junctions, mostly by the use of alternative 3'ss. Modelling the differential junctions in SF3B1(WT) and SF3B1(R625/K666) cell lines demonstrates that the deregulated splice pattern strictly depends on SF3B1 status and on the 3'ss-sequence context. SF3B1(WT) knockdown or overexpression do not reproduce the SF3B1(R625/K666) splice pattern, qualifying SF3B1(R625/K666) as change-of-function mutants. Mutagenesis of predicted branchpoints reveals that the SF3B1(R625/K666)-promoted splice pattern is a direct result of alternative branchpoint usage. Altogether, this study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying splicing alterations induced by mutant SF3B1 in cancer, and reveals a role for alternative branchpoints in disease."
14576937,"Upon the introduction of extensive sampling protocols of sentinel node biopsies, pathologists are increasingly confronted with small melanoma metastases. Using conventional histology, it proves sometimes difficult or impossible to differentiate small melanoma metastases from lymph-node nevi. Loss of the tumour suppressor gene p16 has been shown to be associated with tumour progression of melanoma. We investigated nevus and melanoma cells for the presence of the product of the gene p16, using immunohistochemistry. All nevus cells, independent of their location (nodal or skin) displayed an extensive nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for p16. In contrast, all cells of melanoma metastases, except one skin metastasis, lacked nuclear staining for p16. These findings indicate that p16 is a reliable marker to distinguish lymph-node nevi from melanoma metastasis."
11822878,"We recently identified a novel metastasis suppressor gene, BRMS1, in breast cancer. Since the BRMS1 gene maps to chromosome 11q13.1-q13.2 and since chromosome 11q defects have been described in various stages of human melanoma progression, we hypothesized that BRMS1 may function as a tumor or metastasis suppressor in melanomas as well. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that BRMS1 mRNA expression was high in melanocytes, considerably reduced in early melanoma-derived cell lines, and barely detectable in advanced/metastatic cell lines. Stable transfectants of BRMS1 in the human melanoma cell lines MelJuSo and C8161.9 did not alter the tumorigenicity of either cell line, but significantly suppressed metastasis compared to vector-only transfectants. Orthotopic tumors continued to express BRMS1, but expression was lost in lung metastases. In vitro morphology, growth rate, and histology of BRMS1 transfectants were similar to controls. BRMS1 transfectants were less invasive in a collagen sandwich assay and had restored homotypic gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). Thus, BRMS1 functions as a metastasis suppressor in more than one tumor type (i.e., breast carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma) by modifying several metastasis-associated phenotypes."
16681721,"Metastasis-suppressor genes, by definition, suppress metastasis without affecting tumorigenicity and, hence, present attractive targets as prognostic or therapeutic markers. BRMS1 (breast cancer metastasis suppressor) has recently been identified as a metastasis-suppressor gene for human breast cancer and melanoma. Expression of BRMS1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in multitissue including normal prostate, ovarian, testis, and colon has been detected by northern blot analysis. We hypothesize that the role of BRMS1 in tumor progression may not be limited to breast cancer and melanoma. We previously found that BRMS1 mRNA levels in primary ovarian epithelial carcinomas were significantly lower than that in normal ovarian and benign tumors (P < 0.05), and statistical analysis of BRMS1 mRNA levels revealed that BRMS1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in early tumor stages (I, II) compared with advanced tumor stages (III, IV) in which lymph node or distant metastases were present (P < 0.01). Our data showed that reduced BRMS1 mRNA seems to influence ovarian carcinoma metastatic ability. Therefore, we transfected BRMS1 plasmid into highly malignant ovarian carcinoma cell line, HO-8910PM, and examined cell biologic behaviors including proliferation, adhesion, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. BRMS1 expression did not alter the proliferation of HO-8910PM cells in vitro and primary tumor formation in vivo. But, BRMS1 expression significantly suppressed the cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components and in vitro cell invasion in BRMS1-transfected HO-8910PM cells compared to parental HO-8910PM and vector-only transfectants (HO-8910PM-vect). Furthermore, motility of BRMS1 transfectants was inhibited. lung colony formation of intravenously injected BRMS1 transfectants in nude mice was significantly reduced. Also, BRMS1 transfectants form significantly less metastatic to organs of peritoneal cavity in orthotopically implanted ovarian tumor nude models. We further discovered that BRMS1 expression did downregulate expression of an actin-bundling protein associated with cell motility -fascin, which perhaps is the mechanism underlying BRMS1 suppression of metastasis. These data suggested that in addition to its already described role in breast cancer and melanoma, BRMS1 functions as a metastasis-suppressor gene in ovarian carcinoma by modifying several metastatic-associated phenotypes, offering a new target for therapeutic intervention."
26599548,"Melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, is frequently associated with alterations in several genes, among which the Bcl-2 oncogene plays an important role in progression, chemosensitivity and angiogenesis. Also microRNA (miRNA) are emerging as modulators of melanoma development and progression, and among them, miR-211, located within the melastatin-1/TRPM1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 1 protein) gene, is prevalently expressed in the melanocyte lineage and acts as oncosuppressor. Using several human melanoma cell lines and their Bcl-2 stably overexpressing derivatives, we evaluated whether there was a correlation between expression of Bcl-2 and miR-211. Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated reduced expression of pri-miR-211, miR-211, TRPM1, and MLANA levels, after Bcl-2 overexpression, associated with increased expression of well-known miR-211 target genes. Overexpression of mature miR-211 in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells rescued Bcl-2 ability to increase cell migration. A decreased nuclear localization of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a co-regulator of both miR-211 and TRPM1, and a reduced MITF recruitment at the TRPM1 and MLANA promoters were also evidenced in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells by immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, respectively. Reduction of Bcl-2 expression by small interference RNA confirmed the ability of Bcl-2 to modulate miR-211 and TRPM1 expression. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
19269164,"To evaluate the contribution of MC1R variants to malignant melanoma risk in Israeli Jews, sequencing of the MC1R gene was performed in 132 melanoma patients and 184 ethnically matched controls. Overall, 22 MC1R variants were detected, two were novel (M73I and 496_497insG). Using age and sex-adjusted logistic regression, one specific variant, R151C, conferred significantly increased melanoma risk among Ashkenazim (OR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.3-5.3; p=0.05 after Bonferroni correction). A gene dosage effect was noted, with significantly increased melanoma risk being observed in subjects with at least two variants whether when all variants are pooled (OR=4.8, 95% CI: 2.0-11.2; p=0.002 after Bonferroni correction) or when red hair colour (RHC) variants and non-RHC variants are distinguished (OR=7.6, 95% CI: 2.8-20.3; p=0.0004 after Bonferroni correction). If further studies support these findings, the assessment of MC1R status may be useful in identifying Jewish Israeli individuals at high risk for melanoma."
22665054,"In previous studies, we demonstrated that miR-193b expression is reduced in melanoma relative to benign nevi, and also that miR-193b represses cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 expression. We suggested that stathmin 1 (STMN1) might be a target of miR-193b. STMN1 normally regulates microtubule dynamics either by sequestering free tubulin heterodimers or by promoting microtubule catastrophe. Increased expression of STMN1 has been observed in a variety of human malignancies, but its association with melanoma is unknown. We now report that STMN1 is upregulated during the progression of melanoma relative to benign nevi, and that STMN1 is directly regulated by miR-193b. Using an experimental cell culture approach, overexpression of miR-193b using synthetic microRNAs repressed STMN1 expression, whereas inhibition of miR-193b with anti-miR oligos increased STMN1 expression in melanoma cells. The use of a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-193b directly regulates STMN1 by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of STMN1 mRNA. We further demonstrated that STMN1 is overexpressed in malignant melanoma compared with nevi in two independent melanoma cohorts, and that its level is inversely correlated with miR-193b expression. However, STMN1 expression was not significantly associated with patient survival, Breslow depth, mitotic count or patient age. STMN1 knockdown by small-interfering RNA in melanoma cells drastically repressed cell proliferation and migration potential, whereas ectopic expression of STMN1 using lentivirus increased cell proliferation and migration rates. Subsequent gene expression analysis indicated that interconnected cytoskeletal networks are directly affected following STMN1 knockdown. In addition, we identified deregulated genes associated with proliferation and migration, and revealed that p21(Cip1/Waf1) and p27(Kip) could be downstream effectors of STMN1 signaling. Taken together, our study suggests that downregulation of miR-193b may contribute to increased STMN1 expression in melanoma, which consequently promotes migration and proliferation of tumor cells."
19047166,"Human primary melanoma cells (T1) were found to be more susceptible to lysis by a Melan-A/MART-1-specific CTL clone (LT12) than their metastatic derivative (G1). We show that this differential susceptibility does not involve antigen presentation by target cells, synapse formation between the metastatic target and CTL clone, or subsequent granzyme B (GrB) polarization. Although PI-9, an inhibitor of GrB, was found to be overexpressed in metastatic G1 cells, knockdown of the PI-9 gene did not result in the attenuation of G1 resistance to CTL-induced killing. Interestingly, we show that whereas T1 cells express high levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a dramatically reduced expression was noted on G1 cells. We also showed that sorted ICAM-1+ G1 cells were highly sensitive to CTL-induced lysis compared with ICAM-1- G1 cells. Furthermore, incubation of metastatic G1 cells with IFN-gamma resulted in the induction of ICAM-1 and the potentiation of their susceptibility to lysis by LT12. More importantly, we found that the level of ICAM-1 expression by melanoma cells correlated with decreased PTEN activity. ICAM-1 knockdown in T1 cells resulted in increased phosphorylation of PTEN and the subsequent activation of AKT. We have additionally shown that inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway by the specific inhibitor wortmannin induced a significant potentiation of susceptibility of G1 and ICAM-1 small interfering RNA-treated T1 cells to CTL-induced lysis. The present study shows that a shift in ICAM-1 expression, which was associated with an activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, can be used by metastatic melanoma cells to escape CTL-mediated killing."
21051724,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can contribute to tumorigenesis by acting as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. The authors' previous studies on miR-34a showed that miRNA can influence the growth of uveal melanoma cells. In this study, they investigated the role of miR-137 in the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma."
11129335,"Mutations of the tumour-suppressor gene NF1 (neurofibromatosis 1) have been observed in neurofibromas and neurofibrosarcomas of patients with von Recklinghausen's disease and in sporadic nerve sheath tumours. In contrast, melanoma, another tumour type of neuroectodermal origin, rarely shows NF1 alterations. Desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma (DNM) is an uncommon melanoma subtype that shares morphological characteristics with nerve sheath tumours. Therefore, we analysed 15 DNM and 20 melanomas without morphological features of desmoplasia or neuroid differentiation (common melanomas) for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the NF1 locus and flanking regions. Allelic loss was detected in 10/15 (67%) DNM but only in 1/20 (5%) common melanomas. LOH was most frequently observed at marker IVS38, located in intron 38 of NF1. These data suggest a role for NF1 in the pathogenesis of DNM and support an earlier hypothesis that exon 37 might encode a functional domain. DNM may represent an interesting tumour model tor the further elucidation of the cellular functions and tumour-suppressive potential of neurofibromin."
22583695,"The process of malignant transformation, progression and metastasis of melanoma is not completely understood. Recently, the microarray technology has been used to survey transcriptional differences that might provide insight into the metastatic process, but the validation of changing gene expression during metastatic transition period is poorly investigated. A large body of literature has been produced on the role of the HOX genes network in tumour evolution, suggesting the involvement of HOX genes in several types of human cancers. Deregulated paralogous group 13 HOX genes expression has been detected in melanoma, cervical cancer and odonthogenic tumors. Among these, Hox C13 is also involved in the expression control of the human keratin genes hHa5 and hHa2, and recently it was identified as a member of human DNA replication complexes."
18981472,"Metastasis suppressor genes inhibit one or more steps required for metastasis without affecting primary tumor formation. Due to the complexity of the metastatic process, the development of experimental approaches for identifying genes involved in metastasis prevention has been challenging. Here we describe a genome-wide RNAi screening strategy to identify candidate metastasis suppressor genes. Following expression in weakly metastatic B16-F0 mouse melanoma cells, shRNAs were selected based upon enhanced satellite colony formation in a three-dimensional cell culture system and confirmed in a mouse experimental metastasis assay. Using this approach we discovered 22 genes whose knockdown increased metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth. We focused on one of these genes, Gas1 (Growth arrest-specific 1), because we found that it was substantially down-regulated in highly metastatic B16-F10 melanoma cells, which contributed to the high metastatic potential of this mouse cell line. We further demonstrated that Gas1 has all the expected properties of a melanoma tumor suppressor including: suppression of metastasis in a spontaneous metastasis assay, promotion of apoptosis following dissemination of cells to secondary sites, and frequent down-regulation in human melanoma metastasis-derived cell lines and metastatic tumor samples. Thus, we developed a genome-wide shRNA screening strategy that enables the discovery of new metastasis suppressor genes."
25818589,"Malignant melanoma is a neoplasm of melanocytes, and the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is essential for the existence of melanocytes. MITF's relevance for this cell lineage is maintained in melanoma, where it is an important regulator of survival and balances melanoma cell proliferation with terminal differentiation (pigmentation). The MITF gene is amplified in ~20% of melanomas and MITF mutation can predispose to melanoma development. Furthermore, the regulation of MITF expression and function is strongly linked to the BRAF/MEK/ERK/MAP-kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is deregulated in >90% of melanomas and central target of current therapies. MITF expression in melanoma is heterogeneous, and recent findings highlight the relevance of this heterogeneity for the response of melanoma to MAPK pathway targeting drugs, as well as for MITF's role in melanoma progression. This review aims to provide an updated overview on the regulation of MITF function and plasticity in melanoma with a focus on its link to MAPK signaling."
16982779,"Natural variation in the coding region of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is associated with constitutive pigmentation phenotypes and development of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. We investigated the effect of MC1R variants on melanoma using a large, international population-based study design with complete determination of all MC1R coding region variants. Direct sequencing was completed for 2,202 subjects with a single primary melanoma (controls) and 1,099 subjects with second or higher-order primary melanomas (cases) from Australia, the United States, Canada, and Italy. We observed 85 different MC1R variants, 10 of which occurred at a frequency >1%. Compared with controls, cases were more likely to carry two previously identified red hair (""R"") variants [D84E, R151C, R160W, and D294H; odds ratio (OR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.1-2.2]. This effect was similar among individuals carrying one R variant and one r variant (defined as any non-R MC1R variant; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2) and among those carrying only one R variant (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). There was no statistically significant association among those carrying only one or two r variants. Effects were similar across geographic regions and categories of pigmentation characteristics or number of moles. Our results confirm that MC1R is a low-penetrance susceptibility locus for melanoma, show that pigmentation characteristics may not modify the relationship of MC1R variants and melanoma risk, and suggest that associations may be smaller than previously reported in part due to the study design."
24223182,"SPRY4-IT1 has been reported to have extremely high expression in normal placenta tissues. It is a Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which is associated with cell growth, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in melanoma. A 2.8-fold increase of SPRY4-IT1 expression was validated by Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in severe preeclamptic placenta as compared with that of the normal ones (n=25) in this study. Furthermore, the role of SPRY4-IT1 in proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and network formation ability of trophoblast cells HTR-8/SVneo was assessed. Suppression of SPRY4-IT1 using siRNA treatment and its overexpression using plasmid targeting SPRY4-IT1 were performed in order to explore the biological function of SPRY4-IT1 in the development and progression of trophoblast cells HTR-8/SVneo, in vitro. The results showed that SPRY4-IT1 knockdown enhanced the cell migration and proliferation, and reduced the response of cells to apoptosis. However, exogenous SPRY4-IT1 overexpression significantly decreased the cell migration and proliferation, while increased cell apoptosis. Our study showed for the first time that aberrant expression of lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 might contribute to the abnormal condition of trophoblast cells HTR-8/SVneo. Therefore, we proposed SPRY4-IT1 as a novel lncRNA molecule, which might be associated with the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and might provide a new target for its early diagnosis and treatment."
15606670,Gene expression profiling of melanoma and nevic tissue has demonstrated that pleiotrophin (PTN) is significantly overexpressed in human melanomas.
26016895,"In recent years, considerable advances have been made in the characterization of protein-coding alterations involved in the pathogenesis of melanoma. However, despite their growing implication in cancer, little is known about the role of long noncoding RNAs in melanoma progression. We hypothesized that copy number alterations (CNAs) of intergenic nonprotein-coding domains could help identify long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) associated with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Among several candidates, our approach uncovered the chromosome 6p22.3 CASC15 (cancer susceptibility candidate 15) lincRNA locus as a frequently gained genomic segment in metastatic melanoma tumors and cell lines. The locus was actively transcribed in metastatic melanoma cells, and upregulation of CASC15 expression was associated with metastatic progression to brain metastasis in a mouse xenograft model. In clinical specimens, CASC15 levels increased during melanoma progression and were independent predictors of disease recurrence in a cohort of 141 patients with AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage III lymph node metastasis. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments revealed that CASC15 regulates melanoma cell phenotype switching between proliferative and invasive states. Accordingly, CASC15 levels correlated with known gene signatures corresponding to melanoma proliferative and invasive phenotypes. These findings support a key role for CASC15 in metastatic melanoma."
15120668,"Clinical genetic testing for mutations in CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A), a melanoma susceptibility gene, is now available. The International Melanoma Genetics Consortium advocates that genetic testing for CDKN2A should be done only as part of a research protocol. Experience with genetic testing for other cancer-susceptibility genes indicates that CDKN2A testing has enormous potential for the prevention and detection of a deadly disease. However, clinicians need to understand the benefits and shortcomings of clinical CDKN2A testing so that it can be used advantageously. Here, we examine whether CDKN2A meets the recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for cancer-susceptibility genetic testing. Although genetic testing for hereditary melanoma should, whenever possible, occur within research protocols, it might be successfully done outside of research protocols if attention is paid to selection, education, and counselling needs of patients; valid test interpretation; and the changing of medical management in appropriate individuals."
22736149,"Sinonasal mucosal melanomas (SNMM) of the head and neck regions are rare and aggressive malignancies. Although they can affect patients of any ethnicity, they are more numerous in Chinese patients. The diagnosis and treatment of these tumors can be challenging. Recent studies have reported that Sox10 is a sensitive melanocytic marker for cutaneous melanoma (Nonaka et al. in Am J Surg Pathol 32:1291-1298, 2008). In addition, a CD117 (c-kit) gene mutation has been identified in cutaneous melanomas, indicating that there may be potential therapeutic benefits of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Imatinib. The purpose of this study was to detect and test the immunohistochemical expression of Sox10 and c-kit in mucosal melanomas (MM) arising in the nasal cavities of Chinese patients. Twenty eight patients with mucosal melanomas of the nasal cavity were treated in two major hospitals in China. All cases had been locally diagnosed as primary SNMM. We confirmed all diagnoses with positive immunohistochemical stains for S100 and HMB-45. Additionally, automated immunohistochemistry was performed using a goat polyclonal Sox10 antibody and a monoclonal c-kit antibody counterstained using a standard avidin-biotin complex method. Immunohistochemical positive expression of Sox10 was defined by nuclear stain; and positivity for c-kit resulted in a distinct membranous staining. The extent of nuclear positivity for Sox10 and membranous stain for c-kit was graded by 4 board certified pathologists as follows: 1+, 1-25 % of positive tumor cells; 2+, 25-50 %; 3+, 50-75 %; and 4+, ≥75 %. Sox10 nuclear expression was found in all cases (100 %), with 4+ staining in 26 out of 28 cases (92.8 %) and 3+ staining in two cases with (7.1 %). The overall positivity for S100 staining was 23 out of 28 (82.1 %), with 1+ staining in 10 cases, 2+ staining in 6 cases, 3+ staining in 7 cases, and no staining in 5 cases. The sensitivity and intensity of Sox10 immunohistochemistry were both higher than with S100 immunohistochemistry. Immunopositivity of membranous stain for c-kit (CD117) was seen in 24 out of 28 cases (85.7 %), including 6 tumors that were 4+, eight that were 3+, six that were 2+, and four that showed 1+ staining. Our results demonstrate that Sox10 is a sensitive marker for SNMM and it may possess diagnostic value in addition to that of S100 protein. The expression of c-kit in the majority of MMs suggests that it may be useful in the assessment of these tumors for potential treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors."
22865454,"Metastatic spread of melanoma to the central nervous system (CNS) is a common and devastating manifestation of disease progression, which, despite its clinical importance, remains poorly understood with respect to underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a recently developed preclinical model of spontaneous melanoma CNS metastasis, we have identified alterations in expression of endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) as a potential factor that influences brain metastatic potential. Induced overexpression of this gene mediated enhanced overall metastatic disease, and resulted in an increased incidence of spontaneous CNS metastases. In contrast, the overexpression of other highlighted genes, such as BCL2A1, did not affect the incidence of CNS metastases but nevertheless appears to facilitate intracranial tumor growth. The prometastatic effect in the CNS associated with EDNRB appears to be mediated by the interaction with its ligands resulting in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and thus intracranial melanoma growth. That EDNRB contributes to melanoma metastasis is underscored by the fact that its therapeutic inhibition by the EDNRB-specific inhibitor A192621 translated into improved outcomes when treating mice with either visceral metastases or intracranial tumors. The identification of an influential role of EDNRB in CNS melanoma spontaneous metastasis may provide both a target for therapeutic intervention as well as a potential prognostic marker for patients having an increased predisposition for incidence of CNS melanoma metastases."
22817889,"Despite recent insights into melanoma genetics, systematic surveys for driver mutations are challenged by an abundance of passenger mutations caused by carcinogenic UV light exposure. We developed a permutation-based framework to address this challenge, employing mutation data from intronic sequences to control for passenger mutational load on a per gene basis. Analysis of large-scale melanoma exome data by this approach discovered six novel melanoma genes (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, STK19, and ARID2), three of which-RAC1, PPP6C, and STK19-harbored recurrent and potentially targetable mutations. Integration with chromosomal copy number data contextualized the landscape of driver mutations, providing oncogenic insights in BRAF- and NRAS-driven melanoma as well as those without known NRAS/BRAF mutations. The landscape also clarified a mutational basis for RB and p53 pathway deregulation in this malignancy. Finally, the spectrum of driver mutations provided unequivocal genomic evidence for a direct mutagenic role of UV light in melanoma pathogenesis."
21278793,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a highly conserved serine-threonine protein kinase involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions, cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. Overexpression of ILK in epithelial cells leads to anchorage-independent growth with increased cell cycle progression. Previously, we have shown that ILK upregulation strongly correlates with melanoma progression, invasion and inversely correlates with 5-year survival of melanoma patients. However, the molecular mechanism by which ILK enhances melanoma progression is currently unknown. In the present study, we found that proangiogenic molecule interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the downstream target of ILK in melanoma cells. ILK overexpression increased IL-6, whereas silencing of ILK suppressed IL-6 expression at both messenger RNA and protein levels. ILK also altered the activity and subcellular localization of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) subunit p65. We further found that ILK enhanced the IL-6 gene transcription by promoting the binding of NF-κB p65 to IL-6 promoter. Moreover, ILK overexpression in melanoma cells enhanced the tube-forming ability of endothelial cells in vitro and microvessel formation in vivo. ILK-induced tube and blood vessel formation of endothelial cells was significantly reduced upon IL-6 inhibition in ILK-overexpressing melanoma cells. To delineate the mechanism by which ILK-induced IL-6 production can enhance angiogenesis, further analysis of the downstream targets of IL-6 signaling showed an increased activity of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in ILK-overexpressing cells. As STAT3 binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter, we found that VEGF levels were elevated in ILK-overexpressing cells and declined upon transfection of IL-6 small interfering RNA, suggesting that ILK may regulate VEGF expression through IL-6 pathway by activating STAT3."
12963615,A clinical association has been observed between uveal melanoma and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). This study aims to determine whether the NF1 tumor suppressor gene is mutated in uveal melanoma.
12543799,"Loss of genetic material on chromosome 6 has been associated with progression of human melanomas. We showed previously that introducing chromosome 6 into metastatic human melanoma cell lines suppresses metastasis without affecting the ability of the hybrids to form progressively growing tumors. By subtractive hybridization comparing nonmetastatic chromosome 6-containing (neo6/C8161) versus parental (C8161) metastatic cells, the KISS1 metastasis suppressor gene was isolated. However, KISS1 mapped to chromosome 1q32. To identify upstream regulator(s) of (and downstream effectors of) KISS1, microarray hybridization comparing C8161 and neo6/C8161 variants was performed. TXNIP/VDUP1, a thioredoxin-binding protein, was expressed more highly in neo6/C8161 and in nonmetastatic melanomas. Increased TXNIP expression inhibited metastasis and up-regulated KISS1. Surprisingly, TXNIP also mapped to chromosome 1q. PCR karyotyping that refined the region on chromosome 6 identified CRSP3/DRIP130, a transcriptional coactivator, as a metastasis suppressor. CRSP3 transfectant cells had up-regulated KISS1 and TXNIP expression and were suppressed for metastasis. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR of clinical melanoma samples showed that loss of CRSP3 expression correlated with decreased KISS1 expression and increased metastasis. Thus, we implicated a specific gene on chromosome 6 in the etiology of melanoma metastasis and identified potential up-stream regulators of KISS1 and TXNIP."
19238106,"We have analysed 47 early-onset (< or =40 years) Latvian melanoma patients for the involvement of the melanoma susceptibility loci CDKN2A and CDK4. We observed no disease-related mutations in CDKN2A, but one patient had a CDK4 R24H mutation and strong family history of melanoma. Haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms showed that the Latvian haplotype is unique compared with that of other melanoma families with the R24H mutation. This finding supports the proposal that codon 24 is a mutational hotspot in the CDK4 gene."
21300445,"A decrease in the level of the ROC1 protein, which is involved in cyclin D1 degradation, might explain an increase in cyclin D1 protein in the absence of gene overexpression. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between ROC1 and cyclin D1 expression in skin melanomas. A total of 62 cases of primary skin melanomas and 58 cases of compound melanocytic nevi were assessed. Immunohistochemistry was performed using cyclin D1 and ROC1 antibodies, and fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to assess the amplification of the CCND1 gene. ROC1 was expressed in >50% of cells in 87.9% of the melanocytic nevus cases and in 45.2% of the melanoma cases (p=0.0014). There was a significant negative correlation between ROC1 and cyclin D1 expression in all cases (p=0.0008985). In comparison with cyclin D1, ROC1 expression was increased in 86.2% of the melanocytic nevi and in 45.2% of the melanomas (p<0.001). Among the non-amplified melanomas, 50% expressed cyclin D1 in >50% of the cells and expressed ROC1 in <25%. ROC1 expression is negatively correlated with cyclin D1 expression, demonstrating its importance in the degradation of cyclin D1 in melanomas."
21801332,"We recently identified GLI2, the most active of GLI transcription factors, as a direct TGF-β/SMAD target, whose expression in melanoma cells is associated with increased invasiveness and metastatic capacity. In this work, we provide evidence that high GLI2 expression is inversely correlated with that of the melanocyte-specific transcription factor M-microphthalmia transcription factor (M-MITF) and associated transcriptional program. GLI2-expressing cell lines were characterized by the loss of M-MITF-dependent melanocytic differentiation markers and reduced pigmentation. The balance between M-MITF and GLI2 expression did not correlate with the presence or absence of BRAF-activating mutations, but rather was controlled by two distinct pathways: the TGF-β pathway, which favors GLI2 expression, and the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP pathway, which pushes the balance toward high M-MITF expression. Furthermore, overexpression and knockdown experiments demonstrated that GLI2 and M-MITF reciprocally repress each other's expression and control melanoma cell invasion in an opposite manner. These findings thus identify GLI2 as a critical transcription factor antagonizing M-MITF function to promote melanoma cell phenotypic plasticity and invasive behavior."
21461173,"Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, and its incidence has increased dramatically over the years. The murine B16F10 melanoma in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice has been used as a highly aggressive model to investigate tumor development. Presently, we demonstrate in the B16F10-Nex2 subclone that silencing of SOCS-1, a negative regulator of Jak/Stat pathway, leads to reversal of the tumorigenic phenotype and inhibition of melanoma cell metastasis. SOCS-1 silencing with short hairpin RNA affected tumor growth and cell cycle regulation with arrest at the S phase with large-sized nuclei, reduced cell motility, and decreased melanoma cell invasion through Matrigel. A clonogenic assay showed that SOCS-1 acted as a modulator of resistance to anoikis. In addition, downregulation of SOCS-1 decreased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (mainly the phosphorylated-R), Ins-Rα, and fibroblast growth factor receptor. In vivo, silencing of SOCS-1 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and metastatic development in the lungs. Because SOCS-1 is expressed in most melanoma cell lines and bears a relation with tumor invasion, thickness, and stage of disease, the present results on the effects of SOCS-1 silencing in melanoma suggest that this regulating protein can be a target of cancer therapy."
8864922,"Whilst tumour thickness is of great value in predicting prognosis for groups of patients in different categories, it is of less value for individual patients. It has been proposed that expression of the nm23 gene, a putative tumour suppressor gene, is associated with improved outcome in a number of human neoplasms including malignant melanoma. We assessed nm23 expression in 22 patients who had primary melanomas > 3mm thick. Ten have survived to date and 12 died of melanoma. Using immunohistochemical methods, we found no significant differences in gene expression between the two groups."
25629959,"Melanoma is the most fatal skin cancer, but the etiology of this devastating disease is still poorly understood. Recently, the transcription factor Sox10 has been shown to promote both melanoma initiation and progression. Reducing SOX10 expression levels in human melanoma cells and in a genetic melanoma mouse model, efficiently abolishes tumorigenesis by inducing cell cycle exit and apoptosis. Here, we show that this anti-tumorigenic effect functionally involves SOX9, a factor related to SOX10 and upregulated in melanoma cells upon loss of SOX10. Unlike SOX10, SOX9 is not required for normal melanocyte stem cell function, the formation of hyperplastic lesions, and melanoma initiation. To the contrary, SOX9 overexpression results in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and a gene expression profile shared by melanoma cells with reduced SOX10 expression. Moreover, SOX9 binds to the SOX10 promoter and induces downregulation of SOX10 expression, revealing a feedback loop reinforcing the SOX10 low/SOX9 high ant,m/ii-tumorigenic program. Finally, SOX9 is required in vitro and in vivo for the anti-tumorigenic effect achieved by reducing SOX10 expression. Thus, SOX10 and SOX9 are functionally antagonistic regulators of melanoma development."
22328516,"Neural precursor expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9 (NEDD9), a member of the Cas family of signal transduction molecules, is amplified at the genetic level in melanoma, and elevated expression levels have been shown to correlate with melanoma progression and metastasis. NEDD9 interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor DOCK3 to promote Rac activation and the elongated, mesenchymal-type of tumour cell invasion, but the molecular mechanisms through which NEDD9 promotes melanoma metastasis are not fully understood. We show that signalling through increased NEDD9 levels requires integrin β3 signalling, which leads to elevated phosphorylation of integrin β3. This results in increased Src and FAK but decreased ROCK signalling to drive elongated, mesenchymal-type invasion in environments that contain vitronectin. NEDD9 overexpression does not affect ROCK signalling through activation of RhoA but decreases ROCKII signalling through Src-dependent phosphorylation of a negative regulatory site Tyr722. In NEDD9-overexpressing melanoma cells, inhibition of Src with dasatinib results in a switch from Rac-driven elongated, mesenchymal-type invasion to ROCK-dependent rounded, amoeboid invasion. These findings brings into question whether dasatinib would work as a therapeutic agent to block melanoma invasion and metastasis. On the basis of the in vitro data presented here, a combination treatment of dasatinib and a ROCK inhibitor might be a better alternative in order to inhibit both elongated, mesenchymal-type and rounded, amoeboid motility."
24086281,"Germline mutations in the LKB1 gene (also known as STK11) cause the Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, and somatic loss of LKB1 has emerged as causal event in a wide range of human malignancies, including melanoma, lung cancer, and cervical cancer. The LKB1 protein is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and other downstream targets. Conditional knockout studies in mouse models have consistently shown that LKB1 loss promotes a highly-metastatic phenotype in diverse tissues, and human studies have demonstrated a strong association between LKB1 inactivation and tumor recurrence. Furthermore, LKB1 deficiency confers sensitivity to distinct classes of anticancer drugs. The ability to reliably identify LKB1-deficient tumors is thus likely to have important prognostic and predictive implications. Previous research studies have employed polyclonal antibodies with limited success, and there is no widely-employed immunohistochemical assay for LKB1. Here we report an assay based on a rabbit monoclonal antibody that can reliably detect endogenous LKB1 protein (and its absence) in mouse and human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. LKB1 protein levels determined through this assay correlated strongly with AMPK phosphorylation both in mouse and human tumors, and with mRNA levels in human tumors. Our studies fully validate this immunohistochemical assay for LKB1 in paraffin-embedded formalin tissue sections. This assay should be broadly useful for research studies employing mouse models and also for the development of human tissue-based assays for LKB1 in diverse clinical settings."
12036934,"The retinoblastoma pathway has been implicated in melanoma; however, previous studies of one of the key components of this pathway, cyclin D1 (CD1), failed to find amplification of this gene in a large series of melanomas. We have recently shown that a particular subtype of melanoma, acral melanoma (AM), has frequent amplification of the CD1 locus. This suggested that CD1 might be important in AM and that it may also be important in other melanoma types, even though its copy number may not be altered. We compared CD1 gene copy number and protein expression in 137 invasive primary cutaneous melanomas (71 superficial spreading melanomas, 17 nodular melanomas, 19 lentigo maligna melanomas, 18 AMs, and 12 unclassifiable melanomas) using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. We found frequent amplification of CD1 in AM (44.4%) and occasional amplification in lentigo maligna melanoma (10.5%) and superficial spreading melanoma (5.6%). CD1 protein was overexpressed in all cases with amplifications and in an additional 20% of cases without amplification. We tested the importance of CD1 in cell growth in melanoma by using adenovirus-mediated antisense treatment targeted to CD1 in two melanoma cell lines, one with and the other without CD1 amplification and overexpression. Antisense mediated down-regulation of CD1 induced apoptosis in vitro and led to significant tumor shrinkage of melanoma xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice. However, it did not alter the growth of normal melanocytes. Together, these results suggest that CD1 may be an oncogene in melanoma and that targeting its expression may be therapeutically beneficial."
19029026,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed, noncoding, small RNAs that inhibit protein translation through binding to target mRNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs can regulate tumor cell proliferation and migration. MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a), a potential key effector of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, was studied as a potential tumor suppressor in uveal melanoma."
15760339,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a pivotal role in physiology and pathology. We identified and cloned two novel mRNA isoforms (ABCB 5alpha and ABCB 5beta) of the ABC transporter ABCB 5 in human melanoma cells. The deduced ABCB 5alpha protein appears to be an altered splice variant containing only a putative ABC, whereas the ABCB 5beta isoform shares approximately 70% similarity with ABCB1 (MDR1) and has a deduced topological arrangement similar to that of the whole carboxyl terminal half of the ABCB1 gene product, P-glycoprotein, including an intact ABC. Northern blot, real-time PCR, and conventional RT-PCR were used to verify the expression profiles of ABCB 5alpha/beta. We found that the melanomas included among the NCI-60 panel of cell lines preferentially expressed both ABCB 5alpha and ABCB 5beta. However, ABCB 5alpha/beta expression was undetectable in two amelanotic melanomas (M14 and LOX-IMVI). The expression profile of ABCB 5alpha/beta in all of the other melanomas of the panel was confirmed both by RT-PCR and by sequencing. Neither ABCB 5alpha nor ABCB 5beta expression was found in normal tissues such as liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, lung, colon, small intestines or placenta. ABCB 5alpha/beta mRNAs were also expressed in normal melanocytes and in retinal pigment epithelial cells, suggesting that ABCB 5alpha/beta expression is pigment cell-specific and might be involved in melanogenesis. Our findings indicate that expression of ABCB 5alpha/beta might possibly provide two novel molecular markers for differential diagnosis of melanomas and constitute potential molecular targets for therapy of melanomas."
15958521,"The incidence of melanoma is increasing rapidly, with advanced lesions generally failing to respond to conventional chemotherapy. Here, we utilized DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling techniques to identify molecular determinants of melanoma progression within a unique panel of isogenic human melanoma cell lines. When a poorly tumorigenic cell line, derived from an early melanoma, was compared with two increasingly aggressive derivative cell lines, the expression of 66 genes was significantly changed. A similar pattern of differential gene expression was found with an independently derived metastatic cell line. We further examined these melanoma progression-associated genes via use of a tailored TaqMan Low Density Array (LDA), representing the majority of genes within our cohort of interest. Considerable concordance was seen between the transcriptomic profiles determined by DNA microarray and TaqMan LDA approaches. A range of novel markers were identified that correlated here with melanoma progression. Most notable was TSPY, a Y chromosome-specific gene that displayed extensive down-regulation in expression between the parental and derivative cell lines. Examination of a putative CpG island within the TSPY gene demonstrated that this region was hypermethylated in the derivative cell lines, as well as metastatic melanomas from male patients. Moreover, treatment of the derivative cell lines with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC), restored expression of the TSPY gene to levels comparable with that found in the parental cells. Additional DNA microarray studies uncovered a subset of 13 genes from the above-mentioned 66 gene cohort that displayed re-activation of expression following DAC treatment, including TSPY, CYBA and MT2A. DAC suppressed tumor cell growth in vitro. Moreover, systemic treatment of mice with DAC attenuated growth of melanoma xenografts, with consequent re-expression of TSPY mRNA. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that multiple genes are targeted, either directly or indirectly, by DNA hypermethylation during melanoma progression."
8631588,"The cyclin-dependent kinase-4 inhibitor gene CDKN2, localized at chromosome region 9p21, has been shown to be a familial melanoma gene, though we found that mutations of it are rare in uncultured sporadic melanomas. To determine Whether the region of allelic loss at 9p21 frequently observed in sporadic melanomas includes the CDKN2 locus, new polymorphic microsatellite probes were isolated from the genomic segments surrounding the CDKN2 gene and used for the study of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in melanoma. The LOH study of matched uncultured tumor-constitutional DNA pairs from 66 metastatic cutaneous and 19 primary uveal melanomas showed that 63% and 32% of the respective tumors suffered allelic loss in the 9p21 region. Two regions of common losses which did not include the CDKN2 locus were observed: in a region of common loss near the D9S157 locus, telomeric to the CDKN2 locus, deletions were observed in 51% of informative cases; in the other region of common loss, near the D9S171 locus, centromeric to the CDKN2 locus, deletions were observed in 47% of informative cases. At the D9S974 locus, located within 20 kb of the CDKN2 gene, deletions were observed in 43% of informative cases. Homozygous deletions of the CDKN2 locus were observed in 8 cases of cutaneous melanoma and 2 cases of uveal melanoma; mutations in CDKN2 exon 2 were found in 2 of the 46 cases with allelic deletion in 9p21. Our results support the following conclusions: (i) somatic mutation of the CDKN2 gene is rare in sporadic melanomas with allelic loss at 9p21; (ii) homozygous loss is more frequent than mutation of the CDKN2 gene in sporadic melanomas; (iii) at 9p21-p23 genes other than CDKN2 may be involved in the development of sporadic melanomas."
20862285,"Cancer/testis (CT) genes are expressed only in the germ line and certain tumors and are most frequently located on the X-chromosome (the CT-X genes). Amongst the best studied CT-X genes are those encoding several MAGE protein families. The function of MAGE proteins is not well understood, but several have been shown to potentially influence the tumorigenic phenotype."
19158841,"Childhood cutaneous melanoma is a rare disease with increasing incidence. It is not clear whether it differs from adult melanoma in etiology and clinical evolution. To genetically characterize childhood melanoma, 21 pediatric patients were studied by germ-line analysis of CDKN2A, CDK4, and MC1R genes. In addition, alterations in CDKN2A, c-Kit, BRAF, and NRAS genes were evaluated at the somatic level by direct gene sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and immunohistochemistry. As a control group of susceptible patients, we studied patients from 23 melanoma-prone families. At the germ-line level, CDKN2A and MC1R gene variants were detected in 2/21 and 12/21 pediatric patients and in 9/23 and 19/22 in familial patients. At the somatic level, most lesions (9/14) from pediatric patients showed CDKN2A locus homozygous deletions and a null p16 immunophenotype, whereas most lesions (5/8) from familial patients were disomic and immunoreactive. A c-Kit low-polysomy profile seems to parallel CDKN2A homozygous deletions in pediatric melanoma whereas the single activating mutation observed segregates with familial patients. Loss of KIT protein expression was frequent (7/14) in pediatric melanomas, where metastatic cases were prevalent. BRAF(V600E) mutation occurred at a similar rate (approximately 50%) in lesions from pediatric and familial patients, whereas no NRAS mutations were detected."
23625514,"Cancer/testis (CT) genes are encoded by genes that are normally expressed only in the human germ line but which are activated in various malignancies. CT proteins are frequently immunogenic in cancer patients and their expression is highly restricted to tumors. They are thus important targets for anticancer immunotherapy. In several different tumor types, the expression of CT-X genes is associated with advanced disease and poor outcome, indicating that their expression might contribute to tumorigenesis. CT-X genes encoding members of the MAGE protein family on Xq28 have been shown to potentially influence the tumorigenic phenotype. We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to investigate whether CT-X mapping to the short arm of the X-chromosome might also have tumorigenic properties and therefore be potentially targeted by functional inhibitors in a therapeutic setting. siRNAs specific to GAGE, SSX and XAGE1 were used in cell proliferation, migration and cell survival assays using cell lines derived from melanoma, a tumor type known to present high frequencies of expression of CT antigens. We found that of these, those specific to GAGE and XAGE1 most significantly impeded melanoma cell migration and invasion and those specific to SSX4 and XAGE1 decreased the clonogenic survival of melanoma cells. Our results suggest that GAGE, XAGE1 and SSX4 might each have a role in tumor progression and are possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of melanoma and other malignancies."
23528861,"KIT mutations play an important role during the pathogenesis of melanoma. Acral melanoma, which is the most common type in China, is more likely to harbor activating KIT mutations. Currently, there are few large studies on KIT expression and mutation in acral melanoma, especially in patients with matched primary/secondary pairs. Here, we investigated KIT expression and mutation in 39 primary acral melanomas together with their corresponding secondary tumors (17 lymph node metastases, 6 local recurrences, and 3 skin metastases) and explored the relationship between KIT expression, mutation, and clinicopathologic characteristics. Cytoplasmic and membranous staining for KIT was noted in 17 cases (43.6%) of 39 primary acral melanomas. KIT expression in patients without lymph node metastases at presentation was significantly higher than those with lymph node metastases (P = .024). KIT mutations were detected in 9 (23.1%) of 39 cases of primary acral melanomas. KIT expression did not correlate with KIT mutation status. In 23 cases with primary/secondary pairs, KIT mutations were observed in 6 cases. Comparison of KIT mutations between primary and secondary tumors showed a discordance rate of 13.0% (3/23). We concluded that KIT mutations are common in acral melanoma, and patients with acral melanoma should be screened for KIT mutations. Mutation status may change during metastases/recurrences after diagnosis of primary tumors. This has important clinical implications, and its mechanism needs further investigation."
17171691,"Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A have been shown to predispose to cutaneous malignant melanoma. The M53I mutation is the most common CDKN2A mutation identified in Scottish melanoma patients and is also found in a small number of families in other countries. The aim of this study was to determine whether the occurrence of this mutation is due to a common ancestor originating from Scotland, and if so, to estimate how long ago the mutation arose. We examined 18 families carrying the M53I mutation: six from Scotland, five from Canada, four from Australia, and three from America. Haplotypes derived from segregation of seven informative microsatellite markers flanking CDKN2A were constructed in each family. Our findings show that 14 of 18 families carry a common ancestral haplotype on which the mutation arose approximately 88 generations ago (1-LOD-unit support interval 44-198 generations). This haplotype is very rare in controls, which supports the idea that it is a common founder mutation haplotype. The four M53I families that do not share the consensus haplotype may in fact have arisen from the same founder, but this is potentially obscured by presumed replication slippage for some of the microsatellite markers tested."

18505964,"The tumor suppressors p14(ARF) (ARF) and p16(INK4A) (p16) are encoded by overlapping reading frames at the CDKN2A/INK4A locus on chromosome 9p21. In human melanoma, the accumulated evidence has suggested that the predominant tumor suppressor at 9p21 is p16, not ARF. However, recent observations from melanoma-prone families and murine melanoma models suggest a p16-independent tumor suppressor role for ARF. We analyzed a group of melanoma metastases and cell lines to investigate directly whether somatic alterations to the ARF gene support its role as a p16-independent tumor suppressor in human melanoma, assuming that two alterations (genetic and/or epigenetic) would be required to inactivate a gene."
24968695,The brain is a common target of metastases for melanoma patients. Little is known about the genetic and epigenetic alterations in melanoma brain metastases (MBMs). Unraveling these molecular alterations is a key step in understanding their aggressive nature and identifying novel therapeutic targets.
22551973,"We examined the microRNA signature that distinguishes the most common melanoma histological subtypes, superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) and nodular melanoma (NM). We also investigated the mechanisms underlying the differential expression of histology-specific microRNAs. MicroRNA array performed on a training cohort of 82 primary melanoma tumors (26 SSM, 56 NM), and nine congenital nevi (CN) revealed 134 microRNAs differentially expressed between SSM and NM (P<0.05). Out of 134 microRNAs, 126 remained significant after controlling for thickness and 31 were expressed at a lower level in SSM compared with both NM and CN. For seven microRNAs (let-7g, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-138, miR-181a, miR-191, and miR-933), the downregulation was associated with selective genomic loss in SSM cell lines and primary tumors, but not in NM cell lines and primary tumors. The lower expression level of six out of seven microRNAs in SSM compared with NM was confirmed by real-time PCR on a subset of cases in the training cohort and validated in an independent cohort of 97 melanoma cases (38 SSM, 59 NM). Our data support a molecular classification in which SSM and NM are two molecularly distinct phenotypes. Therapeutic strategies that take into account subtype-specific alterations might improve the outcome of melanoma patients."
24736457,"The BAALC/miR-3151 locus on chromosome 8q22 contains both the BAALC gene (for brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic) and miR-3151, which is located in intron 1 of BAALC. Older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with high expression of both miR-3151 and the BAALC mRNA transcript have a low survival prognosis, and miR-3151 and BAALC expression is associated with poor survival independently of each other. We found that miR-3151 functioned as the oncogenic driver of the BAALC/miR-3151 locus. Increased production of miR-3151 reduced the apoptosis and chemosensitivity of AML cell lines and increased leukemogenesis in mice. Disruption of the TP53-mediated apoptosis pathway occurred in leukemia cells overexpressing miR-3151 and the miR-3151 bound to the 3' untranslated region of TP53. In contrast, BAALC alone had only limited oncogenic activity. We found that miR-3151 contains its own regulatory element, thus partly uncoupling miR-3151 expression from that of the BAALC transcript. Both genes were bound and stimulated by a complex of the transcription factors SP1 and nuclear factor κB (SP1/NF-κB). Disruption of SP1/NF-κB binding reduced both miR-3151 and BAALC expression. However, expression of only BAALC, but not miR-3151, was stimulated by the transcription factor RUNX1, suggesting a mechanism for the partly discordant expression of miR-3151 and BAALC observed in AML patients. Similar to the AML cells, in melanoma cell lines, overexpression of miR-3151 reduced the abundance of TP53, and knockdown of miR-3151 increased caspase activity, whereas miR-3151 overexpression reduced caspase activity. Thus, this oncogenic miR-3151 may also have a role in solid tumors."
18086302,"Recently, periostin (POSTN), a gene encoding a protein with similarity to the fasciclin family and involved in cell survival and angiogenesis, has emerged as a promising marker for tumor progression in various types of human cancers. There is some controversy regarding both POSTN expression levels and the nature of periostin-producing cells within tumors. In this study, we used quantitative RT-PCR to assess periostin gene expression in normal tissues, primary cell cultures, tumor tissues and tumor cell lines."
25572314,"Extensive and multi-dimensional data sets generated from recent cancer omics profiling projects have presented new challenges and opportunities for unraveling the complexity of cancer genome landscapes. In particular, distinguishing the unique complement of genes that drive tumorigenesis in each patient from a sea of passenger mutations is necessary for translating the full benefit of cancer genome sequencing into the clinic. We address this need by presenting a data integration framework (OncoIMPACT) to nominate patient-specific driver genes based on their phenotypic impact. Extensive in silico and in vitro validation helped establish OncoIMPACT's robustness, improved precision over competing approaches and verifiable patient and cell line specific predictions (2/2 and 6/7 true positives and negatives, respectively). In particular, we computationally predicted and experimentally validated the gene TRIM24 as a putative novel amplified driver in a melanoma patient. Applying OncoIMPACT to more than 1000 tumor samples, we generated patient-specific driver gene lists in five different cancer types to identify modes of synergistic action. We also provide the first demonstration that computationally derived driver mutation signatures can be overall superior to single gene and gene expression based signatures in enabling patient stratification and prognostication. Source code and executables for OncoIMPACT are freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/oncoimpact."

16801015,"The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has increased worldwide in the last 20 years. Research on potential risk factors, both environmental and genetic, has led us to some new and interesting conclusions. Ultraviolet radiation is clearly the main environmental risk factor for melanoma, but its relationship is complex and controversial. With regard to genetic factors, the discovery of two types of genes was a great advance in further understanding the biology of the melanocyte. CDKN2A (p16) is the prototype of the high-penetrance, low-prevalence gene related to melanoma. This gene has been studied in some families in which several members have been diagnosed with melanoma. In the general population with non-familial melanoma, low-penetrance, high-prevalence genes such as MC1R seem to be more interesting. Studies on the MC1R gene have not only shown its importance in skin and hair pigmentation, but also in the development of melanoma. Functional studies on CDKN2A and MC1R have led us to new and important conclusions. The analysis of data from studies on families, twins and control cases, with the collaboration of several countries, will lead us to new discoveries. For the primary and secondary prevention of this tumor, we must promote public health campaigns on the dangers of sun exposure and the identification of individuals at high risk."

21077158,"Resulting from a screening for microRNAs differentially regulated in melanocytes and melanoma cells, we found expression of miR-196a to be significantly down-regulated in malignant melanoma cell lines and tissue samples. As it was stated before that miR-196a might negatively regulate expression of the transcription factor HOX-C8, we analyzed HOX-C8 levels in NHEMs and melanoma cells and found a strong up-regulation of HOX-C8 expression in malignant melanoma cell lines and tissue samples compared with melanocytes. Several HOX-C8 target genes are known to be involved in processes such as oncogenesis, cell adhesion, proliferation and apoptosis. We, therefore, aimed to further investigate a potential ""miR-196a → HOX-C8 → HOX-C8 target gene"" relationship. Stable transfection with an miR-196a expression plasmid led to strong down-regulation of HOX-C8 expression in melanoma cells. Luciferase assays using reporter plasmids containing different fragments of the HOX-C8 3'UTR confirmed direct interactions of miR-196a with the HOX-C8 mRNA. Focusing on target genes of HOX-C8, which might play an important role in melanomagenesis, we identified three genes (cadherin-11, calponin-1 and osteopontin) that are up- or down-regulated, respectively, by altered HOX-C8 expression in miR-196a expressing cell clones and are thus indirectly regulated by this microRNA. As those target genes are closely related to important cellular mechanisms such as cell adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling, tumor formation and invasive behavior of tumor cells, altered miR-196a expression exerts strong effects contributing to tumor cell transformation and formation and progression of malignant melanoma. This fact is underlined by a strongly reduced invasive behavior of melanoma cells re-expressing miR-196a in vitro."
24928612,"Sixty years ago, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) was introduced into the clinic. We suggest its full potential in therapy may not have been reached. In this paper, we contrast 6-TG and the more widely used 6-mercaptopurine; discuss 6-TG metabolism, pharmacokinetics, dosage and schedule; and summarize many of the early studies that have shown infrequent but nevertheless positive results with 6-TG treatment of cancers. We also consider studies that suggest that combinations of 6-TG with other agents may enhance antitumor effects. Although not yet tested in man, 6-TG has recently been proposed to treat a wide variety of cancers with a high frequency of homozygous deletion of the gene for methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), often codeleted with the adjacent tumor suppressor CDKN2A (p16). Among the cancers with a high frequency of MTAP deficiency are leukemias, lymphomas, mesothelioma, melanoma, biliary tract cancer, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and lung, pancreatic, and squamous cell carcinomas. The method involves pretreatment with the naturally occurring nucleoside methylthioadenosine (MTA), the substrate for the enzyme MTAP. MTA pretreatment protects normal host tissues, but not MTAP-deficient cancers, from 6-TG toxicity and permits administration of doses of 6-TG that are much higher than can now be safely administered. The combination of MTA/6-TG has produced substantial shrinkage or slowing of growth in two different xenograft human tumor models: lymphoblastic leukemia and metastatic prostate carcinoma with neuroendocrine features. Further development and a clinical trial of the proposed MTA/6-TG treatment of MTAP-deficient cancers seem warranted."
16963426,"Tumour metastasis is a significant contributor to death in cancer patients. So studies on the molecular mechanism of tumor metastasis can provide new prognostic and therapeutic methods. Tumor metastasis suppressor gene is a kind of genes that only suppresses metastasis without affecting tumorigenicity and tumor growth. BRMS1 is a tumor metastasis suppressor gene discovered in breast carcinoma cells in 2000. Its protein product was found to also suppress metastasis of melanoma cells and murine mammary carcinoma cells. BRMS1 is located in the nucleus,and interacts with mSin3-HDAC complex, and can alter the connexin expression profile of breast carcinoma cells, thereby restoring cell-cell communication via gap junctions. This review highlights some recent progress in the study of BRMS1, gives a brief introduction of related genes, and predicts its possible mechanism of action."

25982144,"Malignant melanoma is a very refractory skin tumor due to its high metastasis, poor prognosis, and insensitivity to chemotherapy. Sonodynamic therapy has recently evolved as a potential method to treat cancers. In this study, 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated sonodynamic therapy (ALA-SDT) was used to treat malignant melanoma in vivo."
